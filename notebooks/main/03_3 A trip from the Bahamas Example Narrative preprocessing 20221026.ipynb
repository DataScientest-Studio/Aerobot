While we reviewed the ENOTOC   I noticed that there was no UN HAZMAT number and pointed it out to Captain as something I believed was supposed to be on the ENOTOC. Having flown cargo at multiple previous jobs I am very familiar with the HAZMAT paperwork requirements. However; as the ENOTOC is fairly new and the printout is overly confusing to read and decipher Captain contacted Load Control to get further clarification on the matter and to insure that we were in compliance with the procedure and regulations. Load Control assured us that everything was in order and correct for the flight. I do not recall whether we sent to NOTOC acknowledgment before or after we contacted Load Control for clarification. Apparently my initial intuition that something wasn't right with the paperwork was correct and we should have requested new paperwork be sent. Even today I have no idea what HAZMAT was actually on our aircraft. I believe the primary cause of this error is the cumbersome layout of the ENOTOC format to begin with. Every time we receive an ENOTOC it's like trying to decipher a sudoku puzzle. The columns (location; weight; UN number) don't seem to align with what is being listed for the HAZMAT. Even figuring out the location of the HAZMAT requires finding a number on the form and then referring to the bottom of the form for the actual position (at least I think that's what we do because it's a form that is in such disorder that I'm not even sure if I'm looking at a position number or a weight). To compound this ENOTOC issue was the fact that when we inquired with Load Control they assured us that the paperwork was correct and everything was in compliance with procedure. Where the error occurred is unknown; but more awareness from everybody involved could have easily prevented this error.  I [suggest] a reevaluation of the ENOTOC procedure and paperwork is in order. The ACARS printout needs to be simpler and easier to read. If it can't; then we should return to the previous procedure with a hard copy of the NOTOC paperwork.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":15}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## swine (flu) - not funny"],"metadata":{"id":"u4cON000k_G9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['funny_search'] = df['Narrative_PP_stemmed'].apply(lambda x: 'swine' in x)\n","df2 = df[df['funny_search'] == 1]\n","df2.tail()['Narrative']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nuvnCC_8kb_s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666860056268,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":506,"user":{"displayName":"Project Datascientest","userId":"15618889726029501374"}},"outputId":"068d3ef7-efff-4069-c581-e57736602240"},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["ACN\n","924123    I came to work one night December 2010; shift ...\n","833953    Inbound aircraft cabin system pressure 1 inop....\n","Name: Narrative, dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ACN = 833953\n","df.loc[ACN]['Narrative']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"id":"vlP-CUYekzYj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666860056273,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":17,"user":{"displayName":"Project Datascientest","userId":"15618889726029501374"}},"outputId":"2083ca96-f2e3-4c66-8233-9e1f4264d0d5"},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"Inbound aircraft cabin system pressure 1 inop.

They do not work on hydraulic system overheat. Which continues to cycle ECAMS. At this time I realize this jet is not flying out and my 4 day trip is turning into a 6 day trip. Call on cell to advise Dispatch of aircraft refusal/knowing the issue is not fixable in ZZZZ. Ask to have the First Officer and myself listed on next company flight out.  Company say says to wait and see.  Authorities want aircraft moved from gate to accommodate a new aircraft arrival.  Explain hydraulic system overheat and that I will not move aircraft. They take my name and let me know the airport authorities will make me move it. They don't show anyway.  No assistance from any company representatives at the airport. Stood with the flight attendants for over an hour in the jetway to avoid gate area. Hostile passengers from previous days cancellations. Swine Flu Pandemic scare. No assistance with a place for crew to remain other than jetway.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## boat - not funny"],"metadata":{"id":"-bxLsOZRlUJT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['funny_search'] = df['Narrative_PP_stemmed'].apply(lambda x: 'boat' in x)\n","df2 = df[df['funny_search'] == 1]\n","df2.tail(30)['Narrative']"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"R04pwq3-kzXI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666860056585,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":327,"user":{"displayName":"Project Datascientest","userId":"15618889726029501374"}},"outputId":"655ea4ae-bf20-47fa-bc31-de2f1b19d2df"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["ACN\n","685529    TXWY W IS VERY POORLY MARKED WHEN TAXIING FROM...\n","691106    I WAS OBSERVED FLYING AT APPROX 100 FT AGL OVE...\n","698215    I DEPARTED FROM 5R3 WITH A FRIEND ON A SIGHTSE...\n","716248    I WAS FLYING SBOUND; NEW JERSEY SIDE OF HUDSON...\n","680097    I WAS BOATING THE SEAREY AT A HIGH SPD TXWY TO...\n","671145    I WAS DOING TOUCH-AND-GOES ON A POND.

I BEACHED THE ACFT IN THE MUDFLATS TO THE N OF THE PUBLIC BOAT LAUNCH; SHUT THE ENG DOWN AND WAITED FOR ASSISTANCE.

THE TWR STATED FLY HDG 340 DEGS; THEN GAVE THE FO A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL. I THINK IT WAS DFW TWR. THE FO IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE PLATES AND PULLED THE CORRECT TEX9 DEP PROC FROM THE BOOK. THE FO'S CONFUSION WAS REAL. THERE WERE 2 TEX9 DEP PLATES. AN AREA DEP AND THE ONE FOR DFW INTL.

THE LACK OF COM BTWN CAPT AND FO PRIOR TO TKOF REGARDING THE INITIAL DEP PROC LED TO CONFUSION BY THE CTLR.

THE FO WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH DALLAS AND THE NUMBER OF SURROUNDING ARPTS WITH THE FT WORTH NAME. 3 WERE LISTED ON THE DEP PLATE. THE FO DID NOT THINK TO REF THE INDEX NUMBER UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE. I WAS FIXATED ON THE NAME. WHAT CONFUSED ME THE MOST WAS THE NAMES OF THE ARPTS. I COULD FIND NOWHERE THE NAME OF DFW INTL. I SAW 3 FT WORTH NAMES (SPINKS; MEACHAM; NAS IRB SYCAMORE). MY MISTAKE WAS TO TRUST THE CAPT HAD PULLED THE CORRECT PLATE AND I DID NOT FAMILIARIZE MYSELF ENOUGH WITH THE SURROUNDING AREA. A LESSON LEARNED. SINCE PLTS USE THE 3 LETTER IDENTIFIER TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE CORRECT PLATE; I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CLRER IF THE IDENTIFIER WAS LISTED NEXT TO THE NAMES ON THE ARPTS SERVED LIST OF THE AREA DEP. I THEN WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT NONE OF THE ARPTS LISTED WERE THE ONE I WAS AT.
