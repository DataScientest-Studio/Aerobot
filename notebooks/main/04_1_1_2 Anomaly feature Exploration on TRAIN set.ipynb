       On takeoff from 13R; the F/O (First Officer) was flying and commanded 'Gear Up'. Without recognition of my actions; as I was Pilot Monitoring; his first takeoff of our trip; I put the flap lever from Flaps 1 to Flaps Up. Immediately after this action; the F/O commanded LNAV as he had missed engaging it during his departure brief; and I missed it during my pre-departure cleanup of the MCP (Mode Control Panel). As I selected LNAV for him we got an 'Airspeed Low' aural warning. I immediately looked at the airspeed indicator and saw 155 with a yellow box around it. I told the F/O; Pilot Flying our airspeed was low and to accelerate; but did not recognize my error until we reached 1000 feet AGL and I went to put the flaps up. It was then I recognized the flaps were up and the gear was down. I raised the gear; the aircraft accelerated and the rest of the flight was uneventful.\n","1405273                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I was the PM on a visual approach backed up by the ILS to [destination]. The PF was high and fast and was unable to get stabilized passing through approximately 1000 feet. I was already concerned we were not going to get stabilized earlier on the approach. We were unable [to] mitigate our excess energy during the approach. The aircraft ahead of us called a 20 kt shear at 800 feet. Passing through 1000 feet and struggling to get established we in fact did encounter the 20 kt shear which pushed us well above our 30 flap speed; resulting in the flaps blowing up to 25 as advertised.  There was a couple seconds where we thought about transitioning to a 25 flap approach. I positioned the flaps to 25 and then said 'lets go around and try this again'. The PF said 'going around flaps 20' and we executed a missed approach I believe at approximately 700 or 800 feet. At the positive rate gear up point I reached over and positioned the gear handle to up and the gear retracted normally and then we got two EICAS caution messages. The first was LE (Leading Edge) slat disagree followed by a TE (Trailing Edge) flap disagree caution message. I told the PF he had the aircraft and ATC and I got into the QRH and ran the appropriate checklist which basically had us match the flap handle with our current flap position and select LE and TE ALTN switches to ALTN and select 20 flaps. It was clear the flaps were not moving from the flaps 20 position and we had a landable configuration. Due to the short runway and current wind conditions at [destination] (080-20G30) and our fuel state we elected to divert to [an alternate] with a long runway and relatively calm winds. All checklists were completed and we diverted with no additional complications. I [advised] ATC and requested a vector direct. Our fuel at landing was 5K lbs. Maintenance reset the flaps and ran their appropriate checklist; we took off and landed at [original destination] 3 hours late uneventfully.\n","1105201                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           We were dispatched with the right air conditioning pack inoperative under normal MEL procedures. Due to weather along the SCOTT Arrival; we were being vectored south along the west coast of southern Florida and had been given a clearance to descend to 8;000 and to proceed direct to CARNU to join the CURSO 2 RNAV Arrival. Passing through approximately 13;000 feet at 280 knots with the throttles at idle I looked up to see that the left air conditioning pack had failed - 'INOP' and 'PACK OFF' lights in the pack switch were both illuminated. There were no EICAS messages displayed to correspond with the pack shutdown indications; but the cabin altitude was climbing rapidly and it was clear that the pack was indeed off. I immediately declared an emergency with Miami Center and increased the rate of descent in order to get below 10;000 before the cabin altitude rose to meet the aircraft altitude. In doing so; I exceeded 250 knots below 10;000 for a few minutes; slowing once we leveled off at our cleared altitude of 8;000.We had difficulty locating the proper QRH checklist - the PACK OFF checklist gave guidance only on the need to descend below 10;000 but gave no guidance whatsoever to attempt pack restoration. That guidance was eventually found in the PACK TEMPERATURE checklist - even though there is no caution light labeled 'Pack temperature' (only an INOP light) and we had no EICAS message indicating 'Pack temperature.' Following this checklist; we reinstated the left pack to STBY-N after about 5 minutes of unpressurized flight. The cabin altitude never exceeded approximately 6;000 as we were cleared to descend to 3;000 shortly after our level-off at 8;000 and we hurried down to minimize cabin altitude. The pack operated in STBY mode without tripping again and we landed without further incident.It would be helpful if the QRH index could be changed to 'PACK OFF - PACK TEMP' to allow a search for the actual indication. Also; the PACK OFF checklist should refer to the Pack Temp checklist to assist in attempting to restore the pack; if appropriate.\n","1039048                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We made a normal takeoff and climb except we made provisions for the inoperative autothrottle system which was placarded by Maintenance under MEL. Flap retraction was normal; until the copilot; who was the pilot flying; noticed a slight roll even with the autopilot engaged; as well as the 'LE ASYM;' discrete light and accompanying EICAS message. I told the copilot to keep the speed down which at that time was about 240 KTS.I told Departure that we needed to return and declared an emergency. I told the First Officer to continue to fly and talk to ATC while I ran the QRH procedure with the relief pilot. We entered a hold at 10;000 FT and started to dump fuel after advising ATC. In the hold we configured the aircraft for landing following QRH procedures.At one point the copilot allowed the aircraft speed to deteriorate into stick shaker. He quickly recovered. Once we were ready for the approach we stopped dumping fuel and were vectored to a visual approach to Runway 27R. I took control of the aircraft and also allowed the aircraft speed to slow into stick shaker; forgetting that the auto-throttle system was inoperative. Again we quickly recovered airspeed and continued the approach.An over weight landing was made with a soft touchdown. Maximum reverse was used to slow with minimum manual braking. After exiting the runway we were examined by CFR officials and given the all clear to taxi to a hardstand. Later the co-pilot told me that while we were running the QRH procedure; he had forgotten about the inoperative autothrottle and allowed the airspeed to increase beyond the flap limit for our configuration. I made a subsequent logbook entry stating the overspeed.Although the LE Asymmetry procedure went well and the crew coordination during the emergency event was excellent; airspeed control was a problem. The workload was very high for all crew members and the added complication of the inoperative auto-throttle made it even more difficult. Being as basic aircraft control is paramount; more attention should have been paid to speed control and more attentive crosschecking by the other crew members should have been briefed due to the abnormal throttle situation.\n","1243501                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Directed by SOCAL Departure to maintain 280 KTS below 10;000 feet during climb. Verbally confirmed the clearance and complied with ATC instructions. Similar; on descent; instructed by Chicago Center to maintain 300 KTS until further notice. At 11;000 feet and cleared to 7;000 feet; queried ORD Approach Control as to the speed they wanted from us. Was instructed to maintain 300 knots until further notice and continue our descent; which took us below 10;000 feet at 300 KTS.Followed ATC instructions for non-standard speed below 10;000 feet; which we assumed was for aircraft separation during the climb and the descent.\n","1015869                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cruising 35;000 experienced moderate turbulence; of such intensity also accompanied by extreme wave action that the acft deviated from assigned flight level by 800 FT above FL350. The Captain disconnected the autopilot to avert exceeding structural limits. The acft also exceeded Mmo momentarily. The event lasted approximately 40 to 60 seconds. The Captain was able to return to altitude. The remainder of the flight was uneventful.\n","1699683                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I was the Pilot Flying on the HYDRR1 arrival to 25L approach. Assigned a heading of 290 to intercept the final approach course at an altitude of 4;000 feet and cleared for the visual approach. Speed window open with 180 kts set; flaps 5; auto throttles engaged. From a 290 heading and my situational awareness; I saw that we were going to intercept glide slope well before the localizer in fact beyond SCADE. I started a LVL CHANGE descent to 3;000 feet. I retarded the throttles to idle to begin the descent. Pilot Monitoring (Captain) asked that I go altitude hold immediately to honor the Class B airspace below us. I complied and the altitude window settled at around 3;900 feet. I started to set up to reenter VNAV path when I noticed the airspeed bleeding through 160 kts at the same time the Captain called airspeed. I immediately advanced the throttles to almost the stops and disengaged the autopilot. Airspeed I believe bottomed out around 155 kts and then quickly recovered to 175 kts with no altitude loss. From there it was a routine if tense approach and landing.\n","955393                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Flying at FL410 we entered moderate turbulence which caused the airplane to overspeed.  I reduced the power and it was not slowing down so I reduced the power to idle.  As soon as we got out of the overspeed we encountered more turbulence and the stick shaker activated and disengaged the AP.  I increased to full power and pushed nose down.  Were about 500 feet below 410 when we requested and received clearance for 390.   The engines would not spool up; it took a good 45 seconds.  Approaching 390 we decided to request 370 because it the engines were still not spooled up.  We were given 370 and a 15 degree turn for traffic.\n","1449891                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  While flying a new hire [training] trip on 737-900ER we had a leg to LGA. Due to runway length and ops alert regarding landing cautions we elected to land flaps 40 with brakes max. We were planning on flying the RNAV visual approach. I was cautious about coming to LGA as it had been a few years since landing here before but my student FO was doing a great job so I let him have the landing. We planned for the RNAV visual 31 and briefed as such. Once 15 miles south of airport we were told there was an issue with the current version of that published approach and that we would have to fly the Expressway Visual 31. This approach was a tighter left turn to the runway with no vertical guidance except the VASI. After quickly re-briefing the new approach we continued. The approach was very tight and close to the runway following the procedure making the descent steep and in a tight left turn around a stadium. My FO could barely see the runway for most of the base to final turn and I then had to constantly talk him through the descent and turn. Being in a flaps 40 condition and in a steep (approx 35 deg) turn I saw that he was getting slow and thought I heard the stick shaker come on for a second while I was commanding more thrust be applied.  We were able to land at 1;000 ft and stop without issue but the approach had left us shaken. It was not a safe procedure in the -900ER that close with so much pressure on the runway length.\n","1655779                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I was the FO (First Officer). Approaching overhead MIA; we experienced severe turbulence; resulting in over speed; stick shaker; large height deviations and at least four passengers reported injured. Flight continued with normal landing and disembarkation in ZZZ1.During the initial briefing in ZZZ; I questioned why we were taking a route through south Florida weather when the route [over water] was in the clear. A call to Dispatch was made. The Dispatcher suggested this route because of 2+ hour (traffic related) delays crossing the Gulf of Mexico; reviewed the weather; and made a convincing case that the filed route was safe. Indeed; the filed route was adequate; as long as you could stay clear of all clouds.At XA08z; we were in cruise approaching overhead MIA at FL350; M.77. The Captain and I were discussing our deviation plan around some weather ahead. A deviation decision was reached; but at the moment I was about to call for weather deviation; we were given handoff to a different ZMA sector. I attempted checking into the new ZMA (132.2) with 'weather deviation required'. ZMA did not acknowledge us; but continued directing other traffic. We started a weather contingency turn to avoid weather. During the turn; we clipped the corner of said clouds and experienced +300 ft climb; followed by a descent to 34;200 ft. Also experienced both an over speed and stick shaker before severe turbulence subsided. Event ended; and we returned to assigned altitude. I attempted to report our deviation; as well as our severe turbulence encounter; again with no acknowledgment from ZMA. At XA13z; we were given a new ZMA frequency. I switched to the new ZMA frequency; reported our deviations; and received the expected revised clearance.After the severe turbulence: We were in or near cloud tops and experiencing continuous light chop; but still feeling the sting of the previous event; so we had everyone remain seated until we were sure that we were out of the weather. During this period before the 'flight attendants; check in' call was made; there were many discussions by interphone between the captain and the purser regarding cabin status and passenger injuries. Once the seatbelt sign was off; the initial reported injuries were documented by the Purser. Chief Purser came to the cockpit and reviewed the reported injuries with the Captain. I assumed PF (Pilot Flying) duties and also manned VHF 1 during this period; so I didn't monitor their discussions or the VHF 2 calls that took place; but I did relay the cabin report of a fourth injured passenger to the purser during this time. Ultimately; the reported injuries were such that it was decided that medical personnel would attend to the injured after normal landing in ZZZ1.No help from ATC: Received handoff to a new Miami Center (132.2) sector at XA08z; just as we were about to request left deviations to avoid some weather ahead. New Controller never acknowledged us checking on to his frequency; never acknowledged 'weather deviations required'; and never acknowledged 'severe turbulence' reported after the event. We were able to hear normal (congested frequency) two way communications with all aircraft on 132.2 throughout our time with this particular controller; and we did get the normal handoff to the next ZMA Controller at XA13z.Success: '...be seated immediately... ' works. The flight attendants were all working in the galleys at the time and took their jump seats just before the worst of the turbulence began. No crew injuries were reported.Surprise: This particular cell was a surprise to both the captain and I with regards to intensity. We had both a visual and radar picture before reaching the weather. With our turn; I anticipated we would perhaps have light chop at most. That was not our case.Hindsight is 20/20: Going forward; I will not spend as much time waiting for ATC to authorize a weather deviation if I'm not getting acknowledgment. We waited to deviate until we felt couldn't wait any more; but ultimately; the turn was insufficient to avoid weather completely. That being said; we were both surprised by the strength of what I thought would be just light chop.\n","1556043                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Flight plan paperwork for this flight showed no alternate airport listed or needed with current weather conditions forecasted in Denver. Extra fuel was loaded and listed on the flight plan for possible wind-shear and microbursts. We received an ATC reroute while taxing out for takeoff due to storms and traffic in the Midwest. The new route was about 250 miles longer than planned and actually took us closer to the weather forming over Texas; Colorado; New Mexico and Kansas.Once airborne and closer to Denver we received at least 10 different reroutes from ATC. While descending for Denver we were instructed to hold southeast of Denver. We contacted Dispatch and confirmed an alternate plan if we needed one and it was confirmed by Dispatch and us that ZZZ would be the alternate airport if we needed to go anywhere. We asked ATC the reason for the hold and they said it was due to go arounds in Denver. We briefed the ILS to 34R and discussed our approach speed which would be VREF + 20 knots due to wind-shear and reported gusts. Moderate turbulence was encountered on the descent and approach. While being vectored for the approach ATC needed to give us a few more turns due to multiple go-arounds happening. Not once did they mention it was due to microbursts or wind-shear.We were instructed to contact the final approach controller and they vectored us to join the localizer and cleared us for the ILS approach. We configured the aircraft early due to strong tailwinds while descending as well as for the gusts. While on approach I disconnected the autopilot because it was having trouble maintaining the glide slope while staying on speed. We had a momentary flap load relief from flaps 30 to 25. The auto throttles were also disconnected as their performance maintaining speed was inadequate. When we contacted the tower for landing clearance the controller advised us of a wind-shear alert with a 35 knot loss over the runway as well as a microburst alert for 34R. We immediately executed a missed approach and turned to a westerly heading and then subsequently a southerly heading. We retracted the flaps to zero and reengaged the autopilot and auto throttles and speed was selected to about 20 knots faster than clean speed in order to give us some extra time to figure out a plan.The captain assumed the role of pilot flying while I took the role of pilot monitoring. Looking at our fuel and the weather conditions in Denver it was agreed upon to divert to ZZZ. While proceeding to ZZZ at 11;000 ft. We encountered severe wind shear which caused an immediate and significant loss of airspeed which activated a momentary stick shaker. Stall recovery maneuver was accomplished immediately with no loss of altitude or further speed. We then increased our speed to 250 knots. A successful and safe landing was accomplished at our alternate of ZZZ.\n","1695201                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          During a visual approach to ZZZ; I was the pilot monitoring during a visual approach to Runway XXL. The Pilot Flying was a highly experienced PIC hand-flying a right base to final. There were multiple aircraft in the pattern at ZZZ including training aircraft to the parallel runway to the west and helicopter traffic to the east of our runway. During the base to final turn; I was preoccupied with maintaining visual separation from a Cessna that appeared to be overshooting his runway to our right and a helicopter to our left that was approaching to land on the east ramp. After rolling out on final; I noticed that the pilot flying had selected an altitude below field elevation in the altitude alerter without calling it and also selected Flight Level Change on the guidance panel. This had caused the autothrottles to pull back to flight idle and the speed had decayed to approximately REF minus 10-15 kts and the stall awareness bars had appeared in the PFD. I called 'speed way low' and the pilot flying had already seen it; disconnected autothrottle; added power; and reduced pitch to recover correct speed. Correct approach speed was quickly obtained; the approach was stabilized prior to 500 feet; and we continued to a normal landing.Despite having trained multiple times in recent years to avoid this exact scenario; the 'FLCH Trap' continues to be an issue. Personally; I NEVER use FLCH for descents for exactly that reason but I am reluctant to correct a 'technique' utilized by a fellow pilot; including the use of FLCH for descent. The company has rightly prohibited the use of FLCH during 'approaches' but its use during visual approach is something of a gray area. I believe the use of Flight Level Change should be PROHIBITED FOR ALL DESCENTS below 5;000 feet AGL. In my opinion; FLCH is the most dangerous button on the Flight Guidance Panel. As the pilot monitoring; it was my job to make sure the proper flight path and energy state of the aircraft were maintained but the distraction of multiple aircraft in close proximity and a 'Traffic; Traffic' TCAS alert forced greater attention OUTSIDE the cockpit than inside. In the future; I will be more proactive in refusing to allow my flying partner to utilize Flight Level Change.\n","946191                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            About 2000 feet MSL; after take-off; we received an AV Bay Door Caution EICAS.  Pressurization [cabin altitude]began to rise abnormally.  The QRH procedure for miscellaneous doors required us to verify pressurization as performing properly.  If not; the QRH had us set the pressurization to manual mode; follow a few more steps; and land at nearest suitable airport.  ATC advised of moderate to severe turbulence reported on our route ahead. Our departure airport was VMC and directly behind us. We decided that a return was the safest choice.During the return while we flew through light turbulence the stick shaker activated at  145-150 knots  at about 1200 feet.  We had field in sight and were cleared for a visual.  No action was needed and we were immediately stable again.  We landed overweight at 48;800 lbs and touch down was at 200-300 FPM rate of descent.  Upon exiting the runway the nose wheel steering failed and began to free caster.  We complied with the QRH and the steering remained INOP.  The First Officer called ops for a tow to the gate while I called Maintenance Control who provided a reset procedure that  worked.  Simultaneously; the tug arrived so I opted to be towed back. Local maintenance arrived; performed inspections; and we were cleared of the write-ups.At one point following all of the above events my First Officer asked what he needed to do for me.  I looked to him and said ' we need to wait a minute and let me get my head straight again -- so I can focus on that very question.' This was information/task overload. Once I had that moment we proceeded as required by QRH.\n","1485672                                                                                                                                                                                   The weather conditions were VFR at Redmond; and along our whole route of flight. Ground temperatures were in the 50's (F). I checked the weather report at Pendleton and Pasco; and both airports were reporting clear conditions (no clouds); and visibility of 10 miles. There had been some puffy white clouds on our way to RDM earlier in the day; that had not presented any problems. I noted the same clouds as we departed Redmond. I climbed to our initial altitude of 9000; but noted that this would put us right in the middle of the scattered clouds along our route. I noted the bases to be around 7000; and was told that the MEA along this initial segment was 7000. So I asked for 11000; and was cleared to climb to this new altitude. I did; and this got us above some of the scattered clouds. But some ahead required very small deviations to avoid. But about 40 nm from PDT; I noted a gray build-up ahead that looked more ominous. I asked Seattle Center if they had any precip/weather on their radar in my route of flight; and they said no. My iPad; which had an ADS-B receiver; did not show any weather either. Since I had previously blown right through the puffy white cloud build-ups; I optimistically hoped I'd be thru this weather in 30 seconds or less. But about 20 seconds after penetrating this cloud; I suddenly encountered a pelting of ice on the windshield. It was loud; and rapid; and got my attention! I knew I couldn't out climb it; and I knew that the bases of the clouds were above the terrain; so I asked for a descent. Seattle cleared me lower; and I quickly began a rapid descent. In my haste; I didn't pull the power back initially; and then had Center calling to verify what type of ice and what the temperature was. I checked the temp and looked at the wings to see what type of buildup I was getting. The outside air temp was in the mid 20's (F); and there was minimal build-up on the leading edge. By the time I answered Center; my airspeed was 10 mph (5 knots into the yellow arc). I quickly pulled the power back; and continued my descent. A wing-leveler autopilot had been in use prior to entering the cloud; and I continued to utilize this to reduce my workload; as I adjusted trim for my descent. As I recall; I was cleared to 6000. Just as I reached 6000; I was able to see the ground below; but was still cruising in the base of the clouds. I reported that I could go VFR under the clouds if I could descend further. I could see the ground clearly enough to see that I was still several thousand feet above any terrain below; and my iPad did not show any rising terrain ahead. The controller as I recall said I could descend; but was concerned about the MEA in this area being 6000. I descended to 5000 and was clear of the cloud/weather; and the ice had shed. I then began a climb back to 6000; as it seemed to me the controller was uncomfortable with me at 5000. Part-way to 6000; he came back on asking why I was changing altitude without requesting this with first. I apologized; and he then cleared me back to 6000. I continued the flight without further issues; and landed 20 minutes later.As I reviewed this flight; the following were the learning points I took away:1. If you see some threatening weather; avoid it! Even if the controller and your weather app don't show it; believe your eyes. 2. Aviate; Navigate; Communicate. If I had followed this age-old adage; and asked Center to 'Standby' when asked about the type of ice; amount; and air temp - and instead focused on my instruments; I likely would have avoided the overspeed situation I got into. Perhaps Center could have asked me to report this information 'when able'; which would have made me feel less like I had to do it right away.3. Note what the freezing level is; and whether it is above or below the bottom of the weather/clouds I'll be flying thru or around. Since the aircraft I fly is not certified for flight into known icing; I need to know before and during the flight whether it is safe to proceed. In this case; the freezing level was above the bottom of the clouds; and the base of the clouds was just at the MEA. I might have been better off going VFR below these clouds; as they were several thousand feet above the terrain; and I would have been in temps above freezing. I've just previously had the impression that I'm safer on an Instrument Flight Plan. But another option in this scenario; is that I could have asked for flight following; and stayed VFR under the weather.4. If in doubt about any instructions from ATC; ask for clarification before doing something. After making my descent to 6000; and then to 5000; I assumed the controller wanted/preferred me at 6000; due to the MEA. But I didn't ask for clarify about this; and began climbing back to 6000; catching him off-guard; as I evidently didn't have permission to change altitude.\n","1284450                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This is the second time in so many months that I have been on hold by Dispatch for a weather forecast; but it seems that the weather center is not keeping up with real time conditions. We departed for MDW an hour late; due to MDW forecast for T-Storms and frontal passage. About 15 minutes from landing; the front was about 15 miles away to the north. We were being vectored onto RWY 22L on a NW HDG. ATC put a Company jet between us and another Company approximately 10 miles ahead. To get spacing; they gave us direct STERE (a northerly HDG) and clearance for the approach. Storms were still N of our position and N of STERE by about 7 and 4 miles respectfully.Within about 30 seconds; we started experiencing moderate turbulence and windshear. I told the FO to turn and told ATC we needed a turn. It was granted. In the turn away from weather; we got severe turbulence; to include violent abrupt yaw moments; airspeed flux of 30-40 knots; and bank angles in excess of 45 degrees. ATC gave us an airspeed of 210 or less. I said 'unable.' We had altitude deviation of 500 feet. We escaped to the SW and paralleled the approach course.After it smoothed out; we attempted to reacquire the approach course just south of downtown Chicago. We experienced a very strong updraft. Concerned it would be followed by a downdraft and well above glidepath; we went around to the south. ATC gave us vectors to a visual downwind for another attempt. After switching to Tower; and on base; Tower reported a windshear alert of 35 knots on final. We decided to go around since we were again experiencing large wind shifts. We diverted to our alternate.What disappointed me also was the lack of credibility our pilots in following aircraft put in our report. Two airplanes behind us continued on a similar path; we were just a minute or two before them. They also experienced severe turbulence. After hearing that behind us; I told Chicago Approach; that no other planes should be allowed to fly through that.It was the worst turbulence I had experienced in my flying experience of [over two decades]. Aircraft control was lost for certain periods of time and our other pilots decided it was okay to fly into that. We obviously were not able to maintain our assigned clearance due to the turbulence. We were unable to maintain the assigned course; altitude; or airspeed. The weather center needs to real-time update weather holds for current radar conditions to not place jets in greater danger. Our pilots need to listen up and wise up; and trust Company Pilot reports.\n","1043181                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  250 KIAS speed restriction on SID. [We] briefed on ground during departure briefing. [We] used Level Change 250 on MCP until 11;000 FT MSL to avoid VNAV exceeding 250-KT restriction. [We] encountered wake turbulence from preceding aircraft while on departure climb vectors from Center around 10;000 FT MSL. On climb from 11;000 FT to 12;000 FT announced and selected VNAV; which accelerated climb speed to 270 KIAS. A few minutes later; ATC asked if we were at 250 KTS. We replied; 'Slowing.' TCAS distance from the preceding aircraft was in excess of five miles and the Controller never mentioned a possible deviation. We were assigned FL230 and normal speed leaving 14;000 FT.I simply forgot the speed restriction since it had been so long before that we briefed it due to ground congestion leading to departure delays. Additionally; numerous altitude assignments; heading changes; and frequency changes departing MDW made for a very busy departure. Furthermore; we encountered wake turbulence around 10;000 FT MSL; which added another threat to the departure. I announced the change of speed profile (VNAV); but the pilot not flying didn't challenge my mistake. It might be prudent in the future to change the Econ VNAV speed to the SID assignment of 250 KIAS in case the assignment is forgotten. Also; it would be helpful if the pilot not flying checked in on each new frequency above 10;000 FT MSL with the speed restriction just to serve as a reminder to the flight crew as well as ATC.\n","1661172                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We were given a late decent by the controller that exceeded speed brake capability to descend from 13000 to 2500 at ZZZZ. We had been cleared the Visual to RWY 7 and had set up fly the ILS for the path. The Landing Gear was dropped at about 8000 ft to augment the speed brake and achieve the descent required. It was a steep descent; but should have worked fine. As we approached ZZZZZ; we slowed and configured to flaps 5; and I retracted the speed brake and went to flaps 20. At about 2 miles to ZZZZZ it was apparent that a little more speed brake was required and was re-extended with the intent that it be brief. At this point the approach mode was armed with the GS marker showing about 1.5 dots high. We then immediately; but briefly got GS capture; then GS fail (line through the GS symbol); apparently a false GS capture; and the aircraft began to level off in the turn to capture the localizer. The Auto throttle was slow to respond to the pitch up with the speed brake exacerbating the situation; the result being that the aircraft slowed to stick shaker before the auto throttle had adjusted for the new attitude. I immediately disengaged the autopilot; pitched down; added power and the F/O retracted the speed brake. A safe speed was immediately reestablished. We continued the descent momentarily while we assessed our approach; concluding we were no longer in a safe position to land and executed a go around. We were vectored back to the same approach which concluded uneventfully. The aggressive descent from which we tried to transition to an approach left us with very little leeway to adapt to errors and make corrections. The false GS capture was all it took to push us out of workable flight parameters. I thought we were going to get down in plenty of time; but it was closer than I realized. The FO had suggested early on to get a new vector away from ZZZZZ to build some space; which would have slowed things down and allowed us to capture the GS earlier and maybe adapt to the system failure. I will avoid such aggressive descents in the future to ensure that all the transitions and configuration changes occur in a comfortable sequence instead of all at once.\n","1561388                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The First Officer was the Pilot Flying; and was relatively new to the airplane. During climb on the departure; ATC assigned a heading of 090 degrees for weather. At acceleration altitude; the Captain selected Speed Intervene and 265 knots as a buffer above minimum clean maneuvering speed. During the climb; many altitude assignments were received and complied with. Passing approximately 15000 feet; I noticed the MCP was still in Speed Intervene; and I mentioned it to the First Officer; as there was a lot of difficult ATC communications happening. Approaching several cells; the aircraft encountered heavy moderate turbulence; and since the speed was close to the minimum; the stick shaker activated. The First Officer called out to lower the nose and increase power [and] made a public address to the flight attendants to be seated immediately. Concurrently; the Captain took control of the aircraft and initiated the stall recovery profile. I believe we lost around 2000 feet. The aircraft was recovered and resumed a normal climb and the flight attendants were asked to check in. [There were] no injuries.\n","1404047                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I was training a trainee with very low hours on SLC IFR Classic East Flow; a configuration that we do not do very often. The position was very new to the trainee; so we discussed several things that need to be done and happen on this configuration. We were about to begin a relief briefing when the incident happened. We were coordinating 2 west departures off of 10L with both 3LC and NLC. While this was happening; C90 punches in to our ear and says; 'send Aircraft X around he slowed early.' I do not remember if he used a full call sign; regardless the trainee said; 'say again' and nothing was said. We noticed that Aircraft Y had a large overtake on Aircraft X in front of him. Aircraft X was on a 1 1/2-2 mile final at the time. I took the position over; and decided it was safer to send Aircraft Y around over Aircraft X on short final. This is what I have always been trained to do. I instructed Aircraft Y to fly the localizer and maintain 2;500 ft. I talked with 3LC to advise I was going around on a 3 mile final. 3LC issued me a 220 at 4000 ft instruction for the missed approach. I instructed Aircraft Y to turn right heading 220. No response. A second time I instructed Aircraft Y to turn to a 220; no response. After the third try; Aircraft Y responded and started turning heading 220. A departure off of 22L was turning to a 110 heading off the ground. The traffic on 22L did not turn immediately; forcing the 3LC controller to expedite his climb.There were several things I saw wrong with this scenario. The first and foremost; C90 should not be telling me who to send around in my airspace. We have always been taught; with the exception of an emergency; to send the trailing aircraft around. To tell us to send somebody around in our own airspace; and add the caveat that he 'slowed earlier than instructed;' which was also mentioned in the MOR (Mandatory Occurrence Report) That is a pilot deviation. Aircraft X slowed earlier than instructed; that is no fault to ATC; that is a pilot deviation. After I sent Aircraft Y around and he did not respond to after the third time I tried issuing an instruction; that is a pilot deviation. ORD has a culture that does not hold pilots accountable for when they make mistakes. I notice it all the time working various positions in the tower; the 'whatever' attitude from pilots because they know they won't get in trouble. I understand that not everything needs to be escalated; but this scenario; in my opinion is different. To not be responding immediately to ATC during a missed approach instruction in IMC weather is not acceptable. In the MOR; it clearly indicates that a pilot deviation occurred with Aircraft X.\n","1289282                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Aircraft X was vectored onto a 10 mile ILS Runway 6. 6 nm in trail Aircraft Y was vectored onto a 11 mile ILS Runway 6. Both aircraft were in a constant high speed descent from initial contact so no speeds were issued because it would have been impossible to slow and still make the approach altitude. Aircraft Y was approximately 6 miles behind Aircraft X when turned onto final. I knew of the speed difference; at the time Aircraft X was indicating about 170 on a 5 mile final. Aircraft Y was indicating about 270 turning onto the 11 mile final. I had two IFR popups that had to be issued around the same time. I issued one and then took a coordination call from ZBW about a conflict they were pointing out between two aircraft they had just handed me off at 070; both just on the border of my airspace. I observed the continued speed overtake just before I took the call but thought that Aircraft Y would be slowing anyway and that I would have time to take the call; then go back and adjust speed if necessary. After hanging up I observed Aircraft Y on a 5 nm final indicating 260KT with Aircraft X about 4 nm ahead indicating 140KT. I issued reduce speed to 170KT to Aircraft Y; to which I received the reply; 'we are slowing' leading me to believe they were already trying to slow down but not very successfully due to the rate of descent. At 3.3 nm separation I cancelled Aircraft Y approach clearance and climbed and turned him to the North. Separation decreased to 2.83 nm and 900ft prior to divergence. In this situation I trusted that Aircraft Y would be slower than they actually were due to the proximity to the airport but the high speed descent prevented that from happening. Due to volume and complexity I elected to turn them on final 6 nm behind Aircraft X rather than go through and turn right back because I didn't have time to explain and issue that; and thought that the distance would be adequate with a normal approach speed. A lack of airspace contributed to the high speed descent. I was unable to turn Aircraft Y to the right to make a longer final due to airspace; unable to turn left prior to that because of crossing traffic and I was worried about going through the final due to parachute jumping 5 SE of the final approach course on Aircraft Y's current heading. The design of the airspace and routes in this area is inherently flawed. Both Aircraft X and Aircraft Y were taken off a descend via clearance due to crossing traffic just ahead handed off from ZBW as well; I had to call them to request the heading prior to handoff. On this arrival routing conflicts are built in because of crossing traffic right at the sector boundary. Until ZBW puts the aircraft in handoff status we are not aware of the potential conflicts; requiring almost no preplanning time and immediate call for alternative action upon seeing the handoff flash. Further complicating the situation is the MHT arrivals are on a VNAV descent where the conflict point is not always known and vertical separation cannot be ensured. I recommend changing the arrival STAR by pushing it north by 5nm to deconflict this area. On Runway 6 there is little to no opportunity to sequence aircraft because of the airspace limitations; crossing traffic and parachute activity. Speed control is highly ineffective because of the high speed descent profile and short distance to the final approach course from initial contact.\n","1252039                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We were assigned a direct clearance to [destination] and assigned to maintain 4000 feet. The AWOS led us to believe we would break out of the clouds at approximately 6000. Wing and cowl ant-ice was turned on since the probes were detecting ice. In order to maintain the N2 green arc; the flight spoilers were deployed and the thrust levers were advanced to manage airspeed and provide adequate bleed air.We advised ATC that the field was not in sight and were then told to maintain 3500 until established on any portion of an approach. I proceeded to make a turn to the FAF.I called for configuration of the aircraft and soon after making the turn; we soon acquired the runway once reaching 3500. When I called for flaps 45; I noticed the red airspeed tape was near the final bugged Vref straight in speed.I increased thrust but the stick shaker momentarily activated. I increased power; slightly decreased angle of attack; and retracted spoilers and the aircraft immediately left the undesirable state. However; we were high on approach and we elected to go around for another attempt which we completed without incident.The root cause of this event is my relative inexperience in getting in extremely high workload situations while flying a jet. I was somewhat surprised by ATC instructions as I'd never heard them like this before. I normally keep my hand on spoilers when they're out but because things got so busy near the end; combined with gusty winds and poorer than expected conditions especially due to icing; I forgot about them. I noticed the final Vref speed was within the red stall tape and this initially confused me. I added thrust but caught the spoilers too late.We should have requested the ILS from ATC earlier in the flight in order to decrease workload. I must always remember that as pilot flying I must aviate first then navigate.\n","1746714                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Level at 3000 feet; 190 knots; Flaps 5. Minimum speed approximately 160 knots (aircraft weight about 250K).  Direct BUDEE to join RWY 09 LOC. Co-altitude and 4-5 miles behind a Aircraft Y (on TCAS). Flew through their wake turbulence. We initially rolled right 10 degrees; then rolled quickly left to 25-30 degrees left bank. Never got a bank angle aural warning. First Officer disconnected the autopilot and we simultaneously received a momentary (less than 1 second) stick shaker.  No other cautions or warnings or alerts. Received clearance for and executed the visual approach to 09. Landed with no issues. Made an AML entry. Flew through preceding plane's jet wash. More spacing but tough to judge in light winds.\n","1796448                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              While on visual approach to Runway XX and configuring; we had configured normally through gear down. The Captain called 'flaps 30' and I reached for the handle while looking at the speed. The trend indicator was well below 185 and I was too focused on the trend rather than the actual speed. I was too quick to move the flap handle. We were actually about 187 knots. We got the flap overspeed warning for about one to two seconds as our speed continued to dissipate. It was my first flight from furlough and recurrent training. I was allowing myself to rush; even though there was no need to rush at the time. I made an error of referencing the trend before the actual speed.  I also need to refresh my habit of not touching the flap handle until I have stated 'speed checks.'\n","1239100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was the SIC as we were being vectored for the ILS 12R approach. We were on an intercept heading for the localizer at 3;000 ft. With all anti-icing on; light icing and IMC.  As we intercepted the localizer; the Pilot Flying (PF) remarked 'the numbers are not right'. I started scanning his Flight Director (FD) and noticed that the numbers were still indicating V1; VR; V2; and all departure speeds. At that point I pointed out that I had set Vref on the Standby airspeed indicator at 143 knots. At this point we were fully configured but fast; about 180 knots. The PF asked me to confirm the landing initial page which I was in the process of doing. At some point in the approach the autopilot (AP) and autothrottle (AT) had disconnected but I never heard a disconnect chime for either. We began to slow and were moving high on the Glide Slope which I pointed out to the PF. About this time the AOA was in the yellow arc and as I said 'airspeed' we got a nibble with the stick shaker. The PF added power and accelerated. We were also right of the localizer which I pointed out. The PF mentioned that he was having trouble controlling the airplane's pitch and asked for help pushing. I noticed that the pitch trim was off so we re-engaged it. The PF said lets go around; so he added power and I retracted flaps to 20 degrees. I told tower that we were going around and he gave us runway heading and 4;000 feet. We continued to drift right on our heading which I mentioned to the PF. We were switched to departure and given an altitude of 5;000 feet. As we were passing 4;000 feet we got the annunciation 'PULL UP!! Not seeing the PF changing our pitch or power I simultaneously pulled the nose up and pushed the throttles forward. This caused us to climb above our assigned altitude of 5;000 feet to about 5;700 feet; which approach pointed out as we leveled off and began slowly descending back to 5;000 feet. We reconnected the autopilot and were vectored to the south to re-intercept the ILS; which we completed without further incident.\n","1292901                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Climb out of normal. Cleared to climb to FL340. Oceanic clearance received was for NAT B crossing at FL330. At 110 mi. E of DOGAL; EINN cleared us to FL330. MCP altitude was set and I pushed the Altitude knob to initiate descent. The VNAV cruise page was set for FL330; with a hard tuned speed of M.83 (the assigned speed in the oceanic clearance.) The legs page was also programmed for M.83/FL330 at DOGAL fix. The plane descended to FL330 normally; but we did not notice that at some point the aircraft had slowed to 250 kts. As we crossed DOGAL; we were busy accomplishing the Class II fix procedures; as well as receiving and accomplishing radio communications switch to HF. At the same time; an 'Insufficient Fuel' message displayed in the CDU. It took a moment or two to investigate the reason for the fuel message. We noticed that the Prog Page showed a landing fuel of 3.6 and the landing time had increased about 20-25 minutes over what it initially was. We eventually found that the VNAV cruise page had completely blanked; and all the entered information was now blank. At this time we noticed that the plane had slowed in cruise to 250 kts. (about 40 kt decrease from what it was.) It is unknown when; or how long the 250 kt speed occurred. After reprogramming the VNAV cruise page; the plane accelerated back to M.83; and the Prog Page now showed normal arrival fuel and time. I believe we were not at 250 kts for more than 5 or possibly 10 minutes; but we did apparently cross DOGAL below the assigned M.83 speed. We do not know how or why the VNAV cruise page deleted its entered information.\n","1473949  Flap overspeed on Aircraft X.I was the non-flying pilot as part of the crew on Aircraft X. The Captain was the flying pilot and we also had 2 International Relief Officers (IRO) as part of a 4-man augmented crew. On this departure the Captain exceeded the flap 5 limit speed by 27 knots.This was the last leg of 4 on our 6-day trip together for the Captain and I. On this flight; we were joined by 2 IRO's. We had all been given adequate rest by FAR requirements and personally I had a good night's rest and breakfast before leaving for the airport. With our van time from the hotel of XA45 and the departure at XC15 we arrived quite early to the airport. As a matter of fact; when we arrived at the gate the aircraft was not there yet. The aircraft did show up in plenty of time and we had more than sufficient time to prepare for our departure. The Captain briefed the crew that he would be the flying pilot for today's flight. He gave us a full brief as he was both the Captain but also the pilot flying. Once we received our clearance I checked my IPad to confirm the SID and verified the speed and altitude restrictions loaded in the FMS. Our clearance was for a departure via the SID. I have flown this SID before and pointed out to the Captain during our brief that we had a speed restriction at ZZZZZ of Minimum 180kts/Maximum 230kts to cross below 5000ft and also a speed restriction over ZZZZZ1 of 230kts.I also pointed out that our minimum clean speed for our weight was 260kts. When the Final Weights showed up on the ACARS and we received our Final Takeoff Data it was showing a reduced thrust Takeoff; Flaps 15; Packs ON; Anti-ice OFF; Assumed weight; Assumed temperature; with speeds of V1 171kts; VR 180kts; and V2 184kts.It was a beautiful day with VMC weather. We started our takeoff; I made my call outs and the Captain started his rotation at VR 180; after I called out positive rate of climb the Captain asked for gear up. As we continued the climb the Captain asked for Flaps 5 on schedule. With the Captain still hand-flying he asked for Flaps 1 on schedule. I moved the Flaps to 1 but quickly reminded him of the MAX speed restriction of 230kts. In a rapid event of sequence; the Captain asked for flaps back to 5 as he started to level off the airplane at around 1500ft MSL. This caused the airspeed to increase fast and the Flaps 5 limit speed of 245kts was exceeded. I called out to the Captain that he was overspeeding the Flaps 5 limit speed with to the best of my memory with the events happening so fast; approximately 20-25kts. After a brief moment and verbal inputs from myself and the IRO in the middle seat of the over speed and the climb needed to continue the SID; the Captain pulled the thrust levers back and raised the nose and started a climb which bled the speed off. Tower sent us to departure control and when I finally had an opportunity to check in with them they assigned us a higher altitude and approved unrestricted speed in the climb. Captain moved the thrust levers forward and asked for flaps retraction on schedule and climbed to the assigned altitude. Shortly thereafter he engaged the autopilot. He turned to us and acknowledged the mistake the he had made and apologized to the crew. He debriefed before the IRO's went back for their rest. He pointed out what he had done and that he didn't stick with the plan that was briefed to stay at Flaps 5 and 230kts with LNAV and VNAV engaged prior to takeoff. We all acknowledged the importance of sticking with the original plan of the brief by remaining at flaps 5 and 230kts which would have kept the flaps 5 limit speed from being exceeded. Once the 2 IRO's left the cockpit I suggested to the Captain that we should get [maintenance] on the SATCOM and fill them in on what had happened. The Captain concurred and handed controls over to me while he initiated the call via Dispatch. We also reported the flaps 5 speed exceedance electronically to [maintenance].After landing and taxiing; once talking to ramp; maintenance requested that we leave the flaps at 30. We extended the flaps to 30 before parking at the gate. While deplaning; the maintenance supervisor came to the cockpit and we did another debrief with him where he asked questions as well as filled us in on the procedure that was required by them. Captain called me and shared that the maintenance supervisor had called him and told him that engineering found the flaps 5 limit speed to be exceeded by 27kts.What I take away from this event is how important; especially on a very busy SID; it is to stick with the plan that was briefed. For myself; I wish I would have questioned the Captain's request for Flaps 1 prior to moving the lever instead of moving the flap lever first and then questioning his request. This goes to show that what is normal procedures on almost all the SIDS we fly is not the case on this very busy SID with a very heavy aircraft.This was definitely an eye opener for me being the first situation like this in my career of being in this predicament.\n","1594170                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Approaching in gusty wind conditions 320/19G21 RNAV/GPS [approach] in use. I was the Pilot Flying. Starting about 1;200 feet AGL; I selected auto pilot OFF. I transitioned to VASI guidance. I was receiving consistent call outs from First Officer regarding airspeed fluctuations above and below target. At about 1;100 feet AGL; amber windshear annunciated and I decided to continue the approach. At about 300 [feet] AGL; RED windshear annunciated and First Officer called out 'GO AROUND'. I said no; I want to land! The landing was very smooth with absolutely no side loads or control issues. I wanted to land because I thought the airplane was handling well and that the warnings were related to horizontal wind shifts and not vertical shifts such as micro bursts. Also there were no airport warnings issued during the approach other than a few PIREPS of plus minus changes in airspeed. First Officer was very supportive and professional during this event. After gate arrival and the door open I stepped out onto the jet bridge to greet the customers and many of them shook my hand and were grateful for arriving safely. I am willing to completely cooperate with recommendations moving forward. I felt absolutely confident that this landing would be done safely considering the conditions at the time. I regret not executing a go-around for amber windshear alerts or escape for red windshear alert and further overriding the First Officer call to go around. I have fully committed to respect these procedures moving forward despite blue sky and visibility unlimited!This event occurred because the windshear detection system annunciated due to gusty low level winds and I decided to land rather than go around.Very simple; go around any time amber windshear displays! Had I responded properly; this event would have been avoided.\n","1068232                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ATC warned us of moderate turbulence beginning in 20 minutes. We seated the passengers and flight attendants prior to that time. Without any warning; we encountered a rapid increase of airspeed of about 40 knots. Max speed was noted at .864 mach; 340 KTS. I immediately pulled the power to idle; the overspeed continued for about 20 seconds. I began a slow climb to bleed off speed. We gained less than 200 FT then went back to FL370. In seconds; the plane went from 310 KTS to 220 KTS. I increased thrust to the firewall and there was no increase of speed for about 10-15 seconds. We initiated a descent; with ATC clearance; to get back speed and at that time encountered moderate turbulence. We were in smooth air during the over/under speed and we are confident that no structural damage occurred. Many messages were exchanged between Dispatch and Maintenance; the decision was made to continue to destination. After stabilized; we attempted to locate the buffet speed chart in the manual on our Ipad's. It took me three attempts to login (error message about no wi-fi signal) and a total of more than 5 minutes to get to the performance section. No amount of searches could locate the appropriate document via the search function. I finally searched page by page in the performance chapter and found it. The use of the Ipad is not intuitive and would be vastly improved had I received instruction when given the Ipad.\n","1447009                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      While conducting Operational Experience on a new upgrade student on his first day an unstable approach was executed. ATC left him a little high and then cleared us for a visual approach. The upgrade student brought out spoilers to full without power being back at idle (engines were spooled into mid 50% N1). The airplane was configured to flaps 8; 20 then gear down. Autopilot was disconnected while on a 7 mile modified base to final. The aircraft was on glideslope; but the upgrade student was too fast to bring flaps out to 30. The airplane came through 1;000 AGL at flaps 20 gear down and full spoiler deployed. At this point I told him he was not slowing because his power was not at idle and he was essentially powering through his spoilers. Also I was expecting him to initiate a go around due to the unstable approach. Power went to idle and flaps 30 and 45 were called for and configured. I did not call for the go around because I wanted my upgrade student to realize that we were unstable inside a 1;000 AGL and make the call to go miss himself.Instead; the approach was continued with the airplane being fully configured on speed and stable by around 500-600 AGL. Landing was standard and satisfactory. Upon reaching the gate I debriefed him on the event and told him that inexperienced First Officers may not make the call to go around when the Captain is pilot flying in an unstable approach event. He was told that in the future in that situation a go around must be performed. I used it as a learning tool and also to discuss the safety program.Cause: unstable approach; not fully configured; over flap 45 speed and with spoilers out at 1;000 AGL.\n","1756995                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As pilot flying we departed on Runway XXL; normal takeoff.  As we reached acceleration altitude I reduced power to climb and stated 'climb.' As I said this the Captain started his check in with departure. I waited for him to finish the call and stated 'climb' again. At this point I saw the hook coming up and safe speed was gone. I said something to the nature of we are below flap speed; lowering the nose and accelerating. The hook immediately started going back down; climb never stopped. We made our departure altitudes and continued climb.This all came together at once. The PM was making a call and I believe he mistook what I said. It was clearly a miscommunication. The Captain had mentioned before we left the gate that he had not flown recently; this probably also played a role. We were in a light weight airliner and the climb and acceleration were quicker than we see with full aircraft.For myself I will delay the power call until there is a break in radio calls. Out of habit we pull the power and say climb.\n","1842590                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  During flight training; the student pilot flared aggressively resulting in the airplane being 4 or 5 ft. above the Runway at low speed with flaps fully extended. I told the student to go around. He delayed but added full power after a second or two. He then raised the nose abruptly resulting in an immediate stall warning. I attempted to lower the nose but the student remained on the controls and continued to pull back. As a result; I was unable to reduce the angle of attack. The airplane stalled and began to roll and yaw to the left. The airplane was only a few ft. above the Runway. The student released the controls but the aircraft was stalled and had no control effectiveness. I reduce the thrust to idle to arrest the incipient spin and the airplane landed on the left main landing gear. It was not a hard landing but the airplane continued to roll to the left. The left wingtip contacted the Runway surface. We were then at about a 45 degree angle to the Runway Centerline and exited the Runway into the grass. I regained directional control and brought the airplane to a stop.There were no injuries. As of this writing; the only damage I am aware of is a cracked and broken plastic wing tip and some slightly bent aluminum at the left wing tip. Mechanics are inspecting the airplane now.\n","906591                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I was the First Officer and pilot flying on the ILS/15 Approach into ZZZZ.  During arrival; ATC requested we remain at 17;000 for some time to avoid traffic.  This put us high on the arrival.  I recognized the situation; so I selected full speed brakes.  We were cleared for the approach which allowed up down to 12;200 on an enroute segment; and I planned to put the gear down (early) at that altitude once we slowed below gear limiting speed.The Captain did not recognize we were above gear limiting speed and in an attempt to 'help' put the gear down without first confirming the action with me.  I was unable to get out my 'no!' before he already had the gear down.  I estimate we oversped the gear by at least 10-20 KTS.  I asked for and received a right 360 to lose altitude in VMC conditions and we continued the arrival/approach without further incident.After shutdown we debriefed the situation in great detail and discussed techniques to prevent a recurrence.  The Captain wrote the overspeed up in the logbook and requested a gear inspection be made prior to our next leg.  Mechanics informed us the inspection revealed no anomalies.\n","1449664                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We were on the RNAV approach into ZZZ. For half an hour leading up to this we were experiencing a bumpy ride and were extended out over the lake (off the approach) for sequencing into ZZZ. Gusty winds were reported (180/23 kts/G35KT) on final and aircraft were also reporting plus or minus 20. We were stabilized before 1000 ft; but; shortly thereafter; we experienced plus 15. Still stabilized; but a possible flap overspeed entered my mind. On short final; I received an aural 'Pull Up'. We were not low on the glidepath; nor experiencing an excessive sink rate and over airport property; so I continued and landed without incident in the touchdown zone.\n","1696601                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Center directed us to fly direct to XXXX; a fix on the ILS into ZZZ. He also advised us to descend at our discretion from 17;000 FT to 4;000 FT; which we did. He then later cleared us for the ILS into ZZZ; which we acknowledged. A few minutes later he cleared us for the approach again; which we acknowledged once more. At this point; we were passing abeam the airport from the west; and the FMS sequences to RWY XX and the aircraft began to turn to the right. The captain immediately selected HDG mode to stop the turn and brought the aircraft back on course; The captain tried to re-sequence the FMS; however; he was unable make it fly the course we desired and did not want to be further distracted attempting to. Aware that we had a tailwind and were covering ground quite fast; the captain realized that we were about to go through the localizer course; having not been instructed to executed a procedure turn turn nor considered one myself; he turned off the autopilot and turn the aircraft inbound while descending. He did this at idle thrust; in attempt to capture the glide slope; and be stabilized by 1;000 FT AGL. Once on the glide slope; the captain reduced the descent angle significantly and increased power; however the aircraft got slow and the stick shaker was actuated momentarily; at which point we immediately initiated a go around. ATC had switched controllers; the new controller gave us vectors to re-attempt the ILS; which resulted in a landing. FMS sequencing to runway and initiating an uncommanded turn; associates increase in work load plus distraction attempting to rectify this. ATC clearing us direct XXXXX; clearing us [for] the approach with no indication of how they would like for us to do that. Neither briefing nor expecting to execute a procedure turn. ATC clear us again for the same approach; resulting in a very brief moment of confusion for both of us. Not asking for vector. Attempting to salvage the approach despite being high. Not applying sufficient power to maintain airspeed once on glide slope. Not abandoning the approach sooner and executing a go around earlier. ATC to be more specific if/when expecting us to execute a full procedure ILS. Flight crew did not expect vectors. Flight crew should ask for clarification if uncertain of ATC instructions or stipulations. Do not attempt to salvage the approach; ask for vectors if needed or execute an earlier go around. Proper air speed management; particularly when recovering from idle descent.\n","1751993                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        First Officer (FO) Flying. Entered overcast at approximately 800 AFE [Above Field Elevation]. I reached up to turn on engine anti-ice. Received call to contact Departure. As I contacted Departure; I looked at airspeed and FO was rapidly accelerating through 200 KTS. He had not called 'Flaps Up' (it was a Flaps 1 takeoff). I stated 'Bring your nose up; flaps are coming up now.' As I retracted flaps; I stated again; 'Bring your nose up; you are still accelerating.' Cleaned aircraft up; but shortly after flaps were retracted; got a short duration 'Flap Overspeed' ECAM. Debriefed FO on Flap retraction SOPs and limitations. I was definitely distracted looking at anti-ice; temps; and contacting Departure. In that time; I should have been more aware of FO's profile and our airspeed. FO had recently received a company letter and seemed very distracted over the course of the whole 3-day trip. Overspeed max airspeed wasn't noted; but I expect it wasn't more than 5 knots. Entered into AML and ZZZ1 Maintenance performed an inspection and returned the aircraft to service. We flew the aircraft to ZZZ2 shortly after. FO's distraction with possible furlough; I had just returned from 3 weeks off. 3rd leg of trip and I felt like I was single-pilot for a lot of our trip. I've got to pay more attention to my flying partner when I'm getting task saturated to ensure this doesn't happen again.Should have discussed departure and cleanup procedure in more detail with FO.\n","1380247                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I started the day aware of the weather. It was raining when I woke up a couple hours prior to our wake up call. It was hard steady rain; vertical; with little horizontal lean. At the pick-up point in front of the hotel; the sky was mostly overcast and the air was warm; thick; and heavy with moisture. Convective activity was a consideration from the beginning of the day. Rain and thunder showers were in the vicinity at the time of departure.500 NM from departure; approximately one hour into the flight; just after passing position ZZZZZ; level at FL320; the majority of obvious convective activity was behind us. Sky conditions included an obscuring haze layer above broken clouds with tops at FL300 and smooth air and clear above. We had just settled into cruise flight after completing a seat rotation. The Captain elected the first two hour rest period. The International Relief Pilot was settling in with the flight plan and entering Flight Information Region (FIR) boundaries and 108 mile advance notification distance rings in the FIX page. I was watching the FMC entries was included in my normal instrument and outside scan. The flight was day time/VMC; course appeared clear of CB's; and no returns were being painted by the radar. The FP radar was selected to 80 NM and MP radar was selected to 160 NM; tilt was selected to (-)1 - (-)2 degrees ; brightness to full; gain adjusted to MAX. My attention was directed at normal scan of PFD; Navigation Display; enroute chart; FMC entries and outside.Within the scan; I glanced outside and instantly realized we would not clear the convective cloud boiling a few miles ahead. The cloud top was approximately FL340 and rapidly building. Immediately; I pushed heading SEL and selected a heading into the indicated wind; stated out loud; 'we are not going to clear that cloud!' As the airplane passed through about 10 degrees bank; we penetrated the very edge of the convective cloud. The airspeed jumped below the Vmin foot and stick shaker engaged. My reaction was; click off the autopilot; and maintain the level pitch attitude; existing bank angle; and guard the thrust levers. Within one second of cloud penetration; wind shear and hail were encountered. The windshield was cracked in several locations. We exited the cloud within just a few short seconds in a ten degree bank; about 10 - 15 degrees left of our original heading. I rolled the airplane back to the right through wings level; to its original course; I glanced at the engine instruments to verify normal indications. The airplane was returned to straight and level flight at our assigned altitude prior to re-engaging the autopilot. After a brief assessment of the airplanes condition; the 'Window Damage' checklist was accomplished. The Captain was called to the cockpit and briefed; the FME was briefed and the flight continued to its destination without further incident.Significant airframe and possible engine damage was discovered upon inspection after arrival at the destination airport.\n","999255                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Crossing the Front Range eastbound at FL370; we encountered severe mountain wave with occasionally light wave. Our mach went from .82 to .857; about 5 KT overspeed with the overspeed warning horn on and the throttles closed. There were no hurt crewmembers or guests. The over speed lasted for about 5 seconds; later in the flight my PFD; ND and FMC screens went completely dark and got the warning beeper along with an uncommanded roll to the left of about 10 degrees. I called and discussed all with Dispatch and Maintenance. All agreed ok to continue. No further issues. I understand that there was an issue with the left AC bus.\n","884166                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               While on the VCN8 arrival into PHL we were given a 180 heading off the arrival for spacing. I was becoming obvious from the ATC communications that PHL experiencing some sort of delays but we were not told what. ATC then gave us a 'present position hold'. We advised that we were unable when on a heading due to the automation (must be in NAV and on a route). ATC then instructed us to 'just fly a pattern' so we fly a race track pattern and timed it for 1 1/2 minutes.  ATC was giving numerous aircraft this same clearance and I heard at least 2 that stated they were unable for the same reasons we stated (automation).  After about 30 minutes we were then cleared to continue to PHL via radar vectors. We were given numerous vectors on downwind and across final all while we had a visual on the airport. At this point we were down to about 5;000 LBS of fuel and were starting to mentally prepare for a diversion. We were finally cleared for the ILS 09R while configuring for the approach at approximately 3;000 FT we encountered a loss of 30-40 KTS of airspeed. We recovered and were back to a normal profile almost before we could react. I knew immediately we had encountered a windshear. Final was clear; and there were no windshear advisories; so we continued the approach and landed without incident with 4;500 LBS of fuel remaining. When we were on the ground; I gave a PIREP to the Local Controller and subsequently I heard 2 or 3 aircraft confirm my observations. The concern I have is that there was no indication to us of why we were delayed on our arrival and no indication of possible severe weather. Clearly there was some weather/convective activity at PHL and in all probability was the cause of the delays. We had no indication of possible windshear on the airport. As an instructor pilot; I was very familiar with the aircraft's Speed Error Tape and Acceleration Cue as it pertains to early detection of Windshear. This allowed me to immediately advise the Captain but we were out of it very quickly. Additionally; being aware of a low fuel state puts undue pressure for Plan Continuation Bias. My concern with this incident is ATC's handling of the hold clearance and not warning all aircraft of potential hazardous weather; and the issuance of non standard holding clearances.\n","1450290                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was the pilot not flying. I loaded the route in the FMS and did it by the filed route prior to receiving the clearance. The clearance received was quite different; so I had to adjust the routing. After that; I put the SID in the route and wound up with two GAYLE/GAYEL intersections; GAYEL being the correct one however; I mistakenly erased the correct one. The FO noticed the distances were not correct sitting in the takeoff position. I should have stopped it then but the position would have lost with a long wait. My FO was flying pilot and has been in this airplane for some time. On departure the FO called for flaps up at 200 feet and this distracted me; when his next call was clean wing. Then; he was not tracking the departure; which also distracted me. We were then cleared to GAYEL intersection; which I went direct to and ATC later asked us where we were going and I said GAYEL intersection to which he replied you're going to the wrong intersection and spelled the correct one. We then got a heading and speed restriction; which I asked if the FO had it and he said yes; so I worked on the FMS. The next thing I knew; we were given a query about speed and when I looked up he was going 320 knots. We finally got it sorted out; put in the FMS and went on. It is difficult working with a person and trying to watch the whole airplane. Never doing that again.\n","1585077                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Pre-brief. I briefed and directed all flight attendants to remain seated until I called to allow them to begin service. I also reviewed the [turbulence guidance] commands and procedures with all flight attendants together. This occurred in the [gate] jetway prior to boarding the airplane and was driven by the unusual [local] weather.Pre-departure passenger announcements. I personally greeted the passengers in first class and explained directly the flight attendants would delay their service to them as much as 20-30 minutes. I made a PA announcement to the entire airplane while standing near Row 1 so all passengers could see me. During this welcome announcement I stated; 'When I turn on the seatbelt sign; I'm serious! Don't get up. If you wake and see the sign is on; stay seated. This is for your safety and the safety of my flight attendants.' This announcement is standard for me; and I vary it only as conditions differ from flight to flight.Departure. My FO (First Officer) and I tuned the radar on to view activity to the east while holding short RW XXR. We both varied the tilt and range and concluded we didn't see anything significant in our path out to 160 NM. Turbulence was light to occasional moderate throughout the departure; and we noticed most of the buildups were absent from radar and could see nothing of concern throughout the turn to the east.We were filed 27;000 initially; but ATC advised the smoother rides were higher. We requested 35;000 based on reports and airplane performance. Light and occasional moderate turbulence remained throughout. At level off; we continued to individually assess radar and limited visual cues for storm position; height; and intensity. ATC offered direct ZZZ1; but I declined the offer until we could confirm this routing with dispatch. Based on tilt position and visual cues; it appeared all storm activity was below 35;000 by more than 5;000 feet. However; performance allowed 36;000 so requested and were cleared block 35- to 37;000. We climbed to 36;000. Rather than engage Econ Climb/Cruise; we selected speed 280/.76. The event. At one point the air began to smooth; but could see there was one line of storms remaining. I made the PA announcement for everyone to remain seated and warned we have another set of bumps to pass. As we approached the weather; it appeared to have 'exploded' in front of us and I thought we would be right at the tops. However; within seconds we were completely engulfed and turbulence increased to continuous moderate with occasional severe. I monitor the flight attendants on the interphone routinely. At this time the FA (Flight Attendant) at 2L called the Purser and advised her a woman got up to the lavatory. She also stated that they yelled at her it wasn't safe and to return to her seat. However; the woman continued to the aft lavatory. While she was in the lavatory; turbulence shot up to continuous severe and I disconnected the autopilot to maintain pitch and power (auto throttles remained armed; but I physically guarded them). Airspeed fluctuated from stickshaker to clacker; and altitude dropped to as low as 34;800 feet. Event seemed to last two minutes or more. Once we exited the weather; I confirmed with flight attendants they were good and asked the status of the passenger. They reported they were fine; but the passenger suffered a cut to the forehead. When it was safe for any medical help to leave their seats; Purser requested passengers with medical training to identify themselves. A fire battalion chief and family member fire paramedic responded to the call; treated the woman; and fed information to me that I passed to Medlink. Two male passengers also complained of neck pain. Medlink recommended three Tylenol for each passenger and one Benadryl for the male passenger who vomited. Note: neither Tylenol nor Benadryl are labeled as such in the medical kit and caused confusion to the flight attendants. It took about an hour from the time I could allow first responders to leave their seats to the time I was fed information to pass to Medlink. After several frequency attempts to contact dispatch through ARINC; Medlink confirmation to continue and offer the medication was finally received. Medical personnel met us at the arrival gate and escorted all three injured passengers off the airplane.\n","1199004                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I was working local control with the radar controller switched Aircraft X to me on a visual approach.  I cleared Aircraft X to land runway 4r.  I continued to scan the d-brite and noticed that the radar controller had turn Aircraft Y onto the ILS final and with speeds compression was occurring rapidly and to avoid a tie to the runway threshold I cancelled Aircraft X's landing clearance and turn him to the south heading 180 and then called the traffic that he was going to have to follow to the airport and he reported the traffic in sight so I instructed Aircraft X to follow the traffic and issued the visual approach clearance.\n","1016156                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I was First Officer (pilot not flying). On CANUK arrival; approximately 2 miles inside of HUSKY; we had just leveled off at 8;000 FT MSL. The controller issued us a heading of 020 and descend to 5;000 FT; and contact Approach. Then he said that we would 'be out of the Bravo for one mile.' In my mind I was picturing us leaving the lateral limits of the shelf of the Class B we were in when we made a turn to the northeast. I quickly looked at my Class B chart for Atlanta and cross checked our position with the chart. In my mind; I was concerned that we were still at 250 KIAS and a turn would eventually put us under a different shelf of the Bravo; breaking the 200 KIAS speed limit. After looking at the chart for a moment; I was pretty certain that the turn would not have us leave the Bravo. Even after a few more minutes of analyzing the situation; I was almost sure that we hadn't left the Class B. It was only after we finished the flight; and I had more time to analyze the chart; that I realized the descent momentarily put us below the 8;000 FT shelf for maybe 10 seconds until we entered the next shelf with a floor of 5;000 FT. We were doing 250 KIAS the whole time; so we broke the 200 KIAS speed limit under the Class B for that short time. ATC never said anything about the speed. Cause; the main threats were high workload and some fatigue. This was the fifth leg of the day and approaching 12 hours on duty. I always have my Class B chart available; but it took me a moment to identify our exact position. Obviously; better situational awareness would have helped. By the time I had crosschecked my chart in any detail; we had already gone below the Class B and were actually back into the next shelf; this plus changing frequencies; verifying the altitude selector and changing headings contributed. After the controller advised us that we'd leave the Bravo at one point; I should have said something to keep us from changing heading or altitude until we knew where we'd be leaving the Bravo. The error was breaking the speed limit for about 10 seconds. That would also be the undesired state. Suggestions; even when tired; I am always aware of major safety issues and obvious 'traps' in the operation. I flat out missed this one by having a poor picture in my head of our position. I needed to maintain better situational awareness.\n","899201                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Turning to final for the runway at the end of an all night flight; the Captain slowed the aircraft to a speed below flaps 5 configuration. He called for flaps 5; however no one had heard him call for flaps 1. At this point a stick shaker occurred and the Captain advanced the throttles and the First Officer cycles the flaps to 5. During the ensuing discussion about whether the Captain had called for flaps 1; the aircraft descended about 400 FT below final approach fix altitude. Both myself and the First Officer mentioned the altitude and the Captain climbed back to 3;000 FT. No mention made by Approach and we landed uneventfully. When finishing a long all-night flight; all cockpit crew members have to be aware of the possibility of fatigue related incidents and be extra vigilant to all flight parameters.\n","1314470                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 This event occurred on arrival/approach going into SAN RWY 27. We had set up and briefed an RNAV approach to RWY 27. The Captain was the PF (Pilot Flying). ATC left us high and fast to prepare us for the imminent slam dunk. To further complicate the approach they vectored us in tight to the airport and close to preceding traffic. As we approached the final approach course; ATC finally gave us descent clearance and told us to slow from 250 to 210 to 170 in about the same time frame that it has taken me to type this sentence. With all automation engaged; the aircraft would not slow down to a slow enough speed with the speed brakes extended to configure the flaps; and descending was out of the question. I had to disengage the autothrottle to get the aircraft to slow to flaps extend minus 10 knots; a speed about ten knots into the 'foot' when the speedbrakes were extended beyond half. The entire time this was going on; we were getting higher above the arrival's recommended vertical path; but we were still at 4000-5000 feet MSL and AFL; so we still had time to achieve a stabilized approach. Once slowdown was achieved; and we were able to configure; locate and get adequate spacing on our preceding traffic; we were able to re-acquire the vertical path by around 3000 MSL. Everything was getting back to normal. We were configured with gear; full flaps on a level flight path with autopilot on and autothrottle off. I was about to re-engage the autothrottle and call for the landing checklist; when we received a TCAS ALERT with an amber dot 300 feet below us. We started trying to locate the traffic in the high terrain area east of SAN and I got distracted. When I looked back inside at my PFD; we were about 10-15 knots into the amber airspeed foot. I realized that I had been distracted away from re-engaging the autothrottle. I immediately advanced the thrust levers and re-engaged the autothrottle; and the engines advanced to full power and then pulled back to a normal thrust level once normal speed was achieved. No altitude was lost. We continued the stabilized approach to a normal; uneventful landing. To reiterate; there was no lateral or vertical deviation from flight path. The approach speed we were attempting to fly was approximately 141 knots. According to the FOQA (data); we slowed to 126 knots for about 10 seconds and advanced to full power and flew back to normal speed in about 10 seconds. He also stated that VStall for our weight and configuration was calculated to be 116 knots.I flew the MD-80 and the B-757 for a lot of years; and in those years I heard countless times about how difficult it was to get those aircraft to slow down and go down. Compared to the A321S or H; they are a dream. The A321S/H is difficult to slow below flaps extend speed let alone get ten knots below so that you don't over speed in a gust. If you have to slow quickly to fit in behind traffic; or descend while slowing; and you extend the speedbrakes; the top of the 'foot' is; a lot of times; above your flaps extend speed. The autothrottle will not allow you to go below the top of the foot. You have to disengage the autothrottle in this instance; or maintain level flight until you slow below flaps extend speed; and hope you can make up for the late descent. ATC seems to be completely oblivious to this issue; nor do I expect that they'll ever understand. So; I must adapt my technique to keep us out of the yellow/red. Henceforth; if I have to disengage the autothrottle; I intend to have my right hand on the thrust levers as a constant reminder that I am now the autothrottle. This is not the normal Airbus MO of setting the thrust levers to climb on departure and not touching them again until they are moved to idle in the flare. The downside to this technique is that it takes my right hand out of the picture; and I'll have to direct the PM to do actions thus distracting him/her. Once airspeed issues are overcome; I will re-engage the autothrottle; especially in a high threat environment such as SAN.\n","973859                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Cruising at FL 410; diverting off track to clear thunderstorms in the area.  Still in the clear above the activity; and just passing over the greatest intensity of storms; got some strong up and down drafts that caused the airspeed to increase sharply.  Was immediately on the power levers and the Speed brakes but was unable to keep from exceeding Max Vmo.

ATC gave us 'landing south' when they cleared us for the IVANE5. When the IVANE5 and 18L transition was selected we had a FMC message stating 'drag required after IVANE'. We locked in the altitude crossing at MSTRD at FL 270 so as to have a GEO path for the VNAV. We were on the path and on airspeed for all the fixes leading up to and through LETKE at which time ATC gave us the RWY 23 transition. We selected the 23 transition and we were still on the path and on airspeed. As soon as we crossed LETKE on the path and on airspeed; we got the 'drag required' message again. The First Officer already had full speed brakes selected. The airspeed magenta bug went from 270 for LETKE to 250 for MAJIC and quickly to 230 at BABZE. Even with full speed brakes and a 30 Knot headwind the airplane would not slow down from 270 and increased to 280 and we remained on the path. It was totally impossible for the aircraft to slow down to meet the airspeed requirements at MAJIC or BABZE.So as not to fly above 250 knots below 10;000 feet we elected to come off the path to slow to 250 knots. We were approximately 30 Knots fast at MAJIC and we were high and fast at BABZE. We notified ATC that we were not going to make the airspeed or altitude restrictions at BABZE. ATC asked if we could make JEPHS at 210 knots and 6000 feet; which we said we could; but ATC vectored us off the arrival before we got to JEPHS. On the next flight from CLT on the same aircraft we had a 'FMC DISAGREE VERTICAL' message which we did put into the log book. In summation we were flying the IVANE5 arrival perfectly; and we believe that the arrival itself has a flaw that makes it extremely difficult to meet all the restrictions; or if you have 18L selected and change to runway 23; then at that time the arrival is incompatible with the aircraft limits.\n","1698941                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Today's flight was a standard one until Center asked if we could land in freezing rain as we approached ZZZ. This was a surprise because none was forecasted. I knew we couldn't take off in known or forecasted FZRA (Freezing Rain) or FZDZ (Freezing Drizzle); but I wasn't sure about landing. So I looked it up and sure enough it is prohibited as well. We switched over to Approach and informed them we couldn't land in FZRA and they instructed us to hold over ZZZZZ as published. We were at 15;000 feet; 160 kts; and there were two Caravans already in the holding pattern. One; a thousand feet below and another at two-thousand feet below us. There was a 55 to 60 kt crosswind over the holding area at our altitude. We tried to get the Garmin 750 to hold at the waypoint for more than one turn but it kept sequencing us into the approach. So I elected to use the heading bug; with the autopilot on; to conduct the hold. Plus the autopilot couldn't hold the inbound track on the localizer due to the high winds. I found that a 20 degree wind correction angle was necessary for the inbound leg. In addition; in order to conserve fuel we asked for 10 nm long legs and that two we couldn't get the Garmin to do so it was up to me to make the corrections on each leg. Fortunately all of the bad weather was below us and we were night VMC in the hold. After approximately 4 turns in the hold; approach said the FZRA is now light snow. He started sequencing the other two caravans for the approach. We got our clearance to maintain our outbound heading of 250 and 15;000 feet until he was ready for us. When we were cleared for the approach we were 5 nm outside of ZZZZZ and cleared down to 11;000 feet. We were supposed to cross ZZZZZ at 8;300 feet. So I asked [First Officer] aren't we cleared for the approach? He said yes so I selected vertical speed and 2;400 fpm to get on glide slope. With throttles at flight idle we still accelerated to over 210 kts. Approach called and said we had a 100 kt overtake on the Caravan in front of us. So I selected props 100% and still didn't slow us enough so approach told us to level off at 6;000 feet and canceled the approach clearance. I was searching for the altitude hold button on the autopilot control panel. I have been out of the cockpit for so long I had forgotten where it was and while I was looking for it is when I got the stick shaker alert. I immediately added power and lowered the nose to about 5;800 feet and recovered back to 6;000 feet. I asked [First Officer] what was the air-speed and he said 125 kts. So we took vectors back to start the approach again and requested to climb back up to 9;000 feet. As we climbed the icing just got worse. I told him most clouds contain the most moisture at their cloud tops and it would be better for us to descend and resume the approach. We are spending too much time in heavy icing conditions. So the request was made and I leveled off at 9;000 feet and turned left to 060 to intercept the localizer and I got the stick shaker again. This time I did see 125 kts. I recovered again and resumed the approach. From that point on it was a normal approach to landing. When I did my walk around the airplane was coated in thick ice. The worst that I have seen in three years.Situational awareness. Keep the scan moving. Ask for help from the other pilot such as 'please select ALT HOLD for me.'\n","1264461                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Cruising on Autopilot (AP) at 9;000 direct ZZZ1 about 30 nm southwest of the VOR; I asked ATC for a deviation to the right to avoid an area of heavier precipitation; which they called out to me and I could see on my [GPS weather display].  Once clear of that heaviest area; I turned back north direct ZZZ1; and from ZZZ1 turned direct ZZZ2.  I had been in and out of the bottom of the ceiling at 9;000 MSL; no ice and mostly smooth.   Near ZZZ1 I started to encounter a lot more turbulence and entered solid IMC; in snow and clouds but still no icing.  I was keeping an eye outside to watch in case I needed to ask for lower if evidence of icing began.  ATC called and asked me to maintain 9;000 and repeated the altimeter setting; and I scanned and saw that I was descending through 8;600 MSL; and that the AP had turned off; probably due to the turbulence.  It does have an alarm when this happens but I did not hear it.  At that point I raised the nose to climb back to 9;000; but when I looked over at the Airspeed Indicator (ASI); it was dropping rapidly below 80 knots.  Not wanting to stall in IMC; I lowered the nose substantially.  At this point my scan was uneven and not making sense. I have read a lot of accounts of pilots who are rapidly overcome in situations like this. At that point I decided that the safest course of action would be to continue to descend rapidly to what I knew was warm VMC below me.  I lowered my landing gear; started a rapid descent to around 4;000 MSL; where I broke out of the snow and clouds and could reorient myself.  ATC advised me of closest local airports and asked about assistance; I asked them to stand by.  Once I was back in control and everything was looking normal; I flew on for a while; and continued on to my destination at 7;000 MSL; which from that point would keep me in VMC.  ATC asked me about the nature of the problem and I told them that I lost my AP in IMC and had loss of control.It is clear in hindsight that the reason I was seeing the drop in the ASI was that the pitot was being plugged with ice or snow or water.  I should have had the pitot heat on but did not.  The rest of the instruments could have shown me that; if my scan had been good; but I was only intermittently scanning while the AP was flying in cruise.  While my reaction was certainly a way to stay safe; it may have been an overreaction.   However; I was tired after a long day and knew I was not at my best; and I wanted to get somewhere safe quickly.  I was far from any busy airspace; and [advising ATC] and descending did not cause a scramble to move other aircraft; as far as I know.\n","1576398                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We were given a radar vector for the XX ILS with a clearance to expect ZZZZZ. Due to weather in the area I requested deviation from the radar vector. When sequencing the FMS; I could not find ZZZZZ on the FMS ILS DME XX. I found ZZZZZ1 on the FMS ILS XX. The fixes are similar; but not the same. I verified the fix to expect with ATC and was again given ZZZZZ. Thinking I made an error loading the FMS; I reviewed a few approaches in the FMS. Still I could not find ZZZZZ. Around this time; I heard the autopilot disengage. I asked; 'did you disengage the autopilot.' The answer was no. I immediately thought the yaw damp disengaged. I noticed the airspeed was low. I stated something like; 'your airspeed is slow.' [First Officer] responded; and added full thrust. Although the airspeed was increasing we lost altitude. The airspeed was passing through 200 knots and I mentioned to climb to 12000 feet. The airspeed continued to increase but no change in pitch. I took the controls to return to 12000 feet. ATC gave us a vector to join the approach. I realize I spent too much time fiddling around with the FMS with my head down away from a scan.In the FMS ILS XX; ZZZZZ does not exist. ZZZZZ only exist in the FMS RNAV XX.\n","1008965

We were unable [to] mitigate our excess energy during the approach. The aircraft ahead of us called a 20 kt shear at 800 feet. Passing through 1000 feet and struggling to get established we in fact did encounter the 20 kt shear which pushed us well above our 30 flap speed; resulting in the flaps blowing up to 25 as advertised.  There was a couple seconds where we thought about transitioning to a 25 flap approach. I positioned the flaps to 25 and then said 'lets go around and try this again'. The PF said 'going around flaps 20' and we executed a missed approach I believe at approximately 700 or 800 feet. At the positive rate gear up point I reached over and positioned the gear handle to up and the gear retracted normally and then we got two EICAS caution messages. The first was LE (Leading Edge) slat disagree followed by a TE (Trailing Edge) flap disagree caution message. I told the PF he had the aircraft and ATC and I got into the QRH and ran the appropriate checklist which basically had us match the flap handle with our current flap position and select LE and TE ALTN switches to ALTN and select 20 flaps. It was clear the flaps were not moving from the flaps 20 position and we had a landable configuration.

Due to weather along the SCOTT Arrival; we were being vectored south along the west coast of southern Florida and had been given a clearance to descend to 8;000 and to proceed direct to CARNU to join the CURSO 2 RNAV Arrival. Passing through approximately 13;000 feet at 280 knots with the throttles at idle I looked up to see that the left air conditioning pack had failed - 'INOP' and 'PACK OFF' lights in the pack switch were both illuminated. There were no EICAS messages displayed to correspond with the pack shutdown indications; but the cabin altitude was climbing rapidly and it was clear that the pack was indeed off. I immediately declared an emergency with Miami Center and increased the rate of descent in order to get below 10;000 before the cabin altitude rose to meet the aircraft altitude. In doing so; I exceeded 250 knots below 10;000 for a few minutes; slowing once we leveled off at our cleared altitude of 8;000.We had difficulty locating the proper QRH checklist - the PACK OFF checklist gave guidance only on the need to descend below 10;000 but gave no guidance whatsoever to attempt pack restoration. That guidance was eventually found in the PACK TEMPERATURE checklist - even though there is no caution light labeled 'Pack temperature' (only an INOP light) and we had no EICAS message indicating 'Pack temperature.' Following this checklist; we reinstated the left pack to STBY-N after about 5 minutes of unpressurized flight. The cabin altitude never exceeded approximately 6;000 as we were cleared to descend to 3;000 shortly after our level-off at 8;000 and we hurried down to minimize cabin altitude. The pack operated in STBY mode without tripping again and we landed without further incident.It would be helpful if the QRH index could be changed to 'PACK OFF - PACK TEMP' to allow a search for the actual indication. Also; the PACK OFF checklist should refer to the Pack Temp checklist to assist in attempting to restore the pack; if appropriate.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1039048</th>\n","      <td>We made a normal takeoff and climb except we made provisions for the inoperative autothrottle system which was placarded by Maintenance under MEL.

I told the copilot to keep the speed down which at that time was about 240 KTS.I told Departure that we needed to return and declared an emergency. I told the First Officer to continue to fly and talk to ATC while I ran the QRH procedure with the relief pilot. We entered a hold at 10;000 FT and started to dump fuel after advising ATC. In the hold we configured the aircraft for landing following QRH procedures.At one point the copilot allowed the aircraft speed to deteriorate into stick shaker. He quickly recovered. Once we were ready for the approach we stopped dumping fuel and were vectored to a visual approach to Runway 27R. I took control of the aircraft and also allowed the aircraft speed to slow into stick shaker; forgetting that the auto-throttle system was inoperative. Again we quickly recovered airspeed and continued the approach.An over weight landing was made with a soft touchdown. Maximum reverse was used to slow with minimum manual braking. After exiting the runway we were examined by CFR officials and given the all clear to taxi to a hardstand. Later the co-pilot told me that while we were running the QRH procedure; he had forgotten about the inoperative autothrottle and allowed the airspeed to increase beyond the flap limit for our configuration. I made a subsequent logbook entry stating the overspeed.Although the LE Asymmetry procedure went well and the crew coordination during the emergency event was excellent; airspeed control was a problem. The workload was very high for all crew members and the added complication of the inoperative auto-throttle made it even more difficult. Being as basic aircraft control is paramount; more attention should have been paid to speed control and more attentive crosschecking by the other crew members should have been briefed due to the abnormal throttle situation.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1243501</th>\n","      <td>Directed by SOCAL Departure to maintain 280 KTS below 10;000 feet during climb.

We planned for the RNAV visual 31 and briefed as such. Once 15 miles south of airport we were told there was an issue with the current version of that published approach and that we would have to fly the Expressway Visual 31. This approach was a tighter left turn to the runway with no vertical guidance except the VASI. After quickly re-briefing the new approach we continued. The approach was very tight and close to the runway following the procedure making the descent steep and in a tight left turn around a stadium. My FO could barely see the runway for most of the base to final turn and I then had to constantly talk him through the descent and turn.

Approaching overhead MIA; we experienced severe turbulence; resulting in over speed; stick shaker; large height deviations and at least four passengers reported injured. Flight continued with normal landing and disembarkation in ZZZ1.During the initial briefing in ZZZ; I questioned why we were taking a route through south Florida weather when the route [over water] was in the clear. A call to Dispatch was made. The Dispatcher suggested this route because of 2+ hour (traffic related) delays crossing the Gulf of Mexico; reviewed the weather; and made a convincing case that the filed route was safe. Indeed; the filed route was adequate; as long as you could stay clear of all clouds.At XA08z; we were in cruise approaching overhead MIA at FL350; M.77. The Captain and I were discussing our deviation plan around some weather ahead. A deviation decision was reached; but at the moment I was about to call for weather deviation; we were given handoff to a different ZMA sector. I attempted checking into the new ZMA (132.2) with 'weather deviation required'. ZMA did not acknowledge us; but continued directing other traffic. We started a weather contingency turn to avoid weather. During the turn; we clipped the corner of said clouds and experienced +300 ft climb; followed by a descent to 34;200 ft. Also experienced both an over speed and stick shaker before severe turbulence subsided. Event ended; and we returned to assigned altitude. I attempted to report our deviation; as well as our severe turbulence encounter; again with no acknowledgment from ZMA. At XA13z; we were given a new ZMA frequency. I switched to the new ZMA frequency; reported our deviations; and received the expected revised clearance.After the severe turbulence: We were in or near cloud tops and experiencing continuous light chop; but still feeling the sting of the previous event; so we had everyone remain seated until we were sure that we were out of the weather. During this period before the 'flight attendants; check in' call was made; there were many discussions by interphone between the captain and the purser regarding cabin status and passenger injuries. Once the seatbelt sign was off; the initial reported injuries were documented by the Purser. Chief Purser came to the cockpit and reviewed the reported injuries with the Captain. I assumed PF (Pilot Flying) duties and also manned VHF 1 during this period; so I didn't monitor their discussions or the VHF 2 calls that took place; but I did relay the cabin report of a fourth injured passenger to the purser during this time. Ultimately; the reported injuries were such that it was decided that medical personnel would attend to the injured after normal landing in ZZZ1.No help from ATC: Received handoff to a new Miami Center (132.2) sector at XA08z; just as we were about to request left deviations to avoid some weather ahead. New Controller never acknowledged us checking on to his frequency; never acknowledged 'weather deviations required'; and never acknowledged 'severe turbulence' reported after the event. We were able to hear normal (congested frequency) two way communications with all aircraft on 132.2 throughout our time with this particular controller; and we did get the normal handoff to the next ZMA Controller at XA13z.Success: '...be seated immediately... ' works. The flight attendants were all working in the galleys at the time and took their jump seats just before the worst of the turbulence began. No crew injuries were reported.Surprise: This particular cell was a surprise to both the captain and I with regards to intensity. We had both a visual and radar picture before reaching the weather. With our turn; I anticipated we would perhaps have light chop at most. That was not our case.Hindsight is 20/20: Going forward; I will not spend as much time waiting for ATC to authorize a weather deviation if I'm not getting acknowledgment. We waited to deviate until we felt couldn't wait any more; but ultimately; the turn was insufficient to avoid weather completely. That being said; we were both surprised by the strength of what I thought would be just light chop.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1556043</th>\n","      <td>Flight plan paperwork for this flight showed no alternate airport listed or needed with current weather conditions forecasted in Denver. Extra fuel was loaded and listed on the flight plan for possible wind-shear and microbursts. We received an ATC reroute while taxing out for takeoff due to storms and traffic in the Midwest. The new route was about 250 miles longer than planned and actually took us closer to the weather forming over Texas; Colorado; New Mexico and Kansas.Once airborne and closer to Denver we received at least 10 different reroutes from ATC. While descending for Denver we were instructed to hold southeast of Denver. We contacted Dispatch and confirmed an alternate plan if we needed one and it was confirmed by Dispatch and us that ZZZ would be the alternate airport if we needed to go anywhere. We asked ATC the reason for the hold and they said it was due to go arounds in Denver. We briefed the ILS to 34R and discussed our approach speed which would be VREF + 20 knots due to wind-shear and reported gusts. Moderate turbulence was encountered on the descent and approach. While being vectored for the approach ATC needed to give us a few more turns due to multiple go-arounds happening. Not once did they mention it was due to microbursts or wind-shear.We were instructed to contact the final approach controller and they vectored us to join the localizer and cleared us for the ILS approach. We configured the aircraft early due to strong tailwinds while descending as well as for the gusts. While on approach I disconnected the autopilot because it was having trouble maintaining the glide slope while staying on speed. We had a momentary flap load relief from flaps 30 to 25. The auto throttles were also disconnected as their performance maintaining speed was inadequate. When we contacted the tower for landing clearance the controller advised us of a wind-shear alert with a 35 knot loss over the runway as well as a microburst alert for 34R. We immediately executed a missed approach and turned to a westerly heading and then subsequently a southerly heading. We retracted the flaps to zero and reengaged the autopilot and auto throttles and speed was selected to about 20 knots faster than clean speed in order to give us some extra time to figure out a plan.The captain assumed the role of pilot flying while I took the role of pilot monitoring. Looking at our fuel and the weather conditions in Denver it was agreed upon to divert to ZZZ. While proceeding to ZZZ at 11;000 ft. We encountered severe wind shear which caused an immediate and significant loss of airspeed which activated a momentary stick shaker. Stall recovery maneuver was accomplished immediately with no loss of altitude or further speed. We then increased our speed to 250 knots. A successful and safe landing was accomplished at our alternate of ZZZ.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1695201</th>\n","      <td>During a visual approach to ZZZ; I was the pilot monitoring during a visual approach to Runway XXL. The Pilot Flying was a highly experienced PIC hand-flying a right base to final. There were multiple aircraft in the pattern at ZZZ including training aircraft to the parallel runway to the west and helicopter traffic to the east of our runway. During the base to final turn; I was preoccupied with maintaining visual separation from a Cessna that appeared to be overshooting his runway to our right and a helicopter to our left that was approaching to land on the east ramp. After rolling out on final; I noticed that the pilot flying had selected an altitude below field elevation in the altitude alerter without calling it and also selected Flight Level Change on the guidance panel. This had caused the autothrottles to pull back to flight idle and the speed had decayed to approximately REF minus 10-15 kts and the stall awareness bars had appeared in the PFD. I called 'speed way low' and the pilot flying had already seen it; disconnected autothrottle; added power; and reduced pitch to recover correct speed. Correct approach speed was quickly obtained; the approach was stabilized prior to 500 feet; and we continued to a normal landing.Despite having trained multiple times in recent years to avoid this exact scenario; the 'FLCH Trap' continues to be an issue. Personally; I NEVER use FLCH for descents for exactly that reason but I am reluctant to correct a 'technique' utilized by a fellow pilot; including the use of FLCH for descent. The company has rightly prohibited the use of FLCH during 'approaches' but its use during visual approach is something of a gray area. I believe the use of Flight Level Change should be PROHIBITED FOR ALL DESCENTS below 5;000 feet AGL. In my opinion; FLCH is the most dangerous button on the Flight Guidance Panel. As the pilot monitoring; it was my job to make sure the proper flight path and energy state of the aircraft were maintained but the distraction of multiple aircraft in close proximity and a 'Traffic; Traffic' TCAS alert forced greater attention OUTSIDE the cockpit than inside. In the future; I will be more proactive in refusing to allow my flying partner to utilize Flight Level Change.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>946191</th>\n","      <td>About 2000 feet MSL; after take-off; we received an AV Bay Door Caution EICAS.

There had been some puffy white clouds on our way to RDM earlier in the day; that had not presented any problems. I noted the same clouds as we departed Redmond. I climbed to our initial altitude of 9000; but noted that this would put us right in the middle of the scattered clouds along our route. I noted the bases to be around 7000; and was told that the MEA along this initial segment was 7000. So I asked for 11000; and was cleared to climb to this new altitude.

I asked Seattle Center if they had any precip/weather on their radar in my route of flight; and they said no. My iPad; which had an ADS-B receiver; did not show any weather either. Since I had previously blown right through the puffy white cloud build-ups; I optimistically hoped I'd be thru this weather in 30 seconds or less. But about 20 seconds after penetrating this cloud; I suddenly encountered a pelting of ice on the windshield. It was loud; and rapid; and got my attention!

In my haste; I didn't pull the power back initially; and then had Center calling to verify what type of ice and what the temperature was. I checked the temp and looked at the wings to see what type of buildup I was getting. The outside air temp was in the mid 20's (F); and there was minimal build-up on the leading edge. By the time I answered Center; my airspeed was 10 mph (5 knots into the yellow arc). I quickly pulled the power back; and continued my descent. A wing-leveler autopilot had been in use prior to entering the cloud; and I continued to utilize this to reduce my workload; as I adjusted trim for my descent. As I recall; I was cleared to 6000. Just as I reached 6000; I was able to see the ground below; but was still cruising in the base of the clouds. I reported that I could go VFR under the clouds if I could descend further. I could see the ground clearly enough to see that I was still several thousand feet above any terrain below; and my iPad did not show any rising terrain ahead. The controller as I recall said I could descend; but was concerned about the MEA in this area being 6000. I descended to 5000 and was clear of the cloud/weather; and the ice had shed. I then began a climb back to 6000; as it seemed to me the controller was uncomfortable with me at 5000. Part-way to 6000; he came back on asking why I was changing altitude without requesting this with first. I apologized; and he then cleared me back to 6000. I continued the flight without further issues; and landed 20 minutes later.As I reviewed this flight; the following were the learning points I took away:1. If you see some threatening weather; avoid it! Even if the controller and your weather app don't show it; believe your eyes. 2. Aviate; Navigate; Communicate. If I had followed this age-old adage; and asked Center to 'Standby' when asked about the type of ice; amount; and air temp - and instead focused on my instruments; I likely would have avoided the overspeed situation I got into. Perhaps Center could have asked me to report this information 'when able'; which would have made me feel less like I had to do it right away.3. Note what the freezing level is; and whether it is above or below the bottom of the weather/clouds I'll be flying thru or around. Since the aircraft I fly is not certified for flight into known icing; I need to know before and during the flight whether it is safe to proceed. In this case; the freezing level was above the bottom of the clouds; and the base of the clouds was just at the MEA. I might have been better off going VFR below these clouds; as they were several thousand feet above the terrain; and I would have been in temps above freezing. I've just previously had the impression that I'm safer on an Instrument Flight Plan. But another option in this scenario; is that I could have asked for flight following; and stayed VFR under the weather.4. If in doubt about any instructions from ATC; ask for clarification before doing something. After making my descent to 6000; and then to 5000; I assumed the controller wanted/preferred me at 6000; due to the MEA. But I didn't ask for clarify about this; and began climbing back to 6000; catching him off-guard; as I evidently didn't have permission to change altitude.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1284450</th>\n","      <td>This is the second time in so many months that I have been on hold by Dispatch for a weather forecast; but it seems that the weather center is not keeping up with real time conditions. We departed for MDW an hour late; due to MDW forecast for T-Storms and frontal passage. About 15 minutes from landing; the front was about 15 miles away to the north. We were being vectored onto RWY 22L on a NW HDG. ATC put a Company jet between us and another Company approximately 10 miles ahead. To get spacing; they gave us direct STERE (a northerly HDG) and clearance for the approach. Storms were still N of our position and N of STERE by about 7 and 4 miles respectfully.Within about 30 seconds; we started experiencing moderate turbulence and windshear. I told the FO to turn and told ATC we needed a turn. It was granted. In the turn away from weather; we got severe turbulence; to include violent abrupt yaw moments; airspeed flux of 30-40 knots; and bank angles in excess of 45 degrees. ATC gave us an airspeed of 210 or less. I said 'unable.' We had altitude deviation of 500 feet. We escaped to the SW and paralleled the approach course.After it smoothed out; we attempted to reacquire the approach course just south of downtown Chicago. We experienced a very strong updraft. Concerned it would be followed by a downdraft and well above glidepath; we went around to the south. ATC gave us vectors to a visual downwind for another attempt. After switching to Tower; and on base; Tower reported a windshear alert of 35 knots on final. We decided to go around since we were again experiencing large wind shifts. We diverted to our alternate.What disappointed me also was the lack of credibility our pilots in following aircraft put in our report. Two airplanes behind us continued on a similar path; we were just a minute or two before them. They also experienced severe turbulence. After hearing that behind us; I told Chicago Approach; that no other planes should be allowed to fly through that.It was the worst turbulence I had experienced in my flying experience of [over two decades]. Aircraft control was lost for certain periods of time and our other pilots decided it was okay to fly into that. We obviously were not able to maintain our assigned clearance due to the turbulence. We were unable to maintain the assigned course; altitude; or airspeed. The weather center needs to real-time update weather holds for current radar conditions to not place jets in greater danger. Our pilots need to listen up and wise up; and trust Company Pilot reports.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1043181</th>\n","      <td>250 KIAS speed restriction on SID.

On climb from 11;000 FT to 12;000 FT announced and selected VNAV; which accelerated climb speed to 270 KIAS. A few minutes later; ATC asked if we were at 250 KTS. We replied; 'Slowing.' TCAS distance from the preceding aircraft was in excess of five miles and the Controller never mentioned a possible deviation. We were assigned FL230 and normal speed leaving 14;000 FT.I simply forgot the speed restriction since it had been so long before that we briefed it due to ground congestion leading to departure delays. Additionally; numerous altitude assignments; heading changes; and frequency changes departing MDW made for a very busy departure. Furthermore; we encountered wake turbulence around 10;000 FT MSL; which added another threat to the departure. I announced the change of speed profile (VNAV); but the pilot not flying didn't challenge my mistake. It might be prudent in the future to change the Econ VNAV speed to the SID assignment of 250 KIAS in case the assignment is forgotten. Also; it would be helpful if the pilot not flying checked in on each new frequency above 10;000 FT MSL with the speed restriction just to serve as a reminder to the flight crew as well as ATC.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1661172</th>\n","      <td>We were given a late decent by the controller that exceeded speed brake capability to descend from 13000 to 2500 at ZZZZ. We had been cleared the Visual to RWY 7 and had set up fly the ILS for the path. The Landing Gear was dropped at about 8000 ft to augment the speed brake and achieve the descent required. It was a steep descent; but should have worked fine. As we approached ZZZZZ; we slowed and configured to flaps 5; and I retracted the speed brake and went to flaps 20. At about 2 miles to ZZZZZ it was apparent that a little more speed brake was required and was re-extended with the intent that it be brief. At this point the approach mode was armed with the GS marker showing about 1.5 dots high. We then immediately; but briefly got GS capture; then GS fail (line through the GS symbol); apparently a false GS capture; and the aircraft began to level off in the turn to capture the localizer. The Auto throttle was slow to respond to the pitch up with the speed brake exacerbating the situation; the result being that the aircraft slowed to stick shaker before the auto throttle had adjusted for the new attitude. I immediately disengaged the autopilot; pitched down; added power and the F/O retracted the speed brake. A safe speed was immediately reestablished. We continued the descent momentarily while we assessed our approach; concluding we were no longer in a safe position to land and executed a go around. We were vectored back to the same approach which concluded uneventfully. The aggressive descent from which we tried to transition to an approach left us with very little leeway to adapt to errors and make corrections. The false GS capture was all it took to push us out of workable flight parameters. I thought we were going to get down in plenty of time; but it was closer than I realized. The FO had suggested early on to get a new vector away from ZZZZZ to build some space; which would have slowed things down and allowed us to capture the GS earlier and maybe adapt to the system failure. I will avoid such aggressive descents in the future to ensure that all the transitions and configuration changes occur in a comfortable sequence instead of all at once.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1561388</th>\n","      <td>The First Officer was the Pilot Flying; and was relatively new to the airplane.

During the climb; many altitude assignments were received and complied with. Passing approximately 15000 feet; I noticed the MCP was still in Speed Intervene; and I mentioned it to the First Officer; as there was a lot of difficult ATC communications happening.

The position was very new to the trainee; so we discussed several things that need to be done and happen on this configuration. We were about to begin a relief briefing when the incident happened. We were coordinating 2 west departures off of 10L with both 3LC and NLC. While this was happening; C90 punches in to our ear and says; 'send Aircraft X around he slowed early.' I do not remember if he used a full call sign; regardless the trainee said; 'say again' and nothing was said. We noticed that Aircraft Y had a large overtake on Aircraft X in front of him. Aircraft X was on a 1 1/2-2 mile final at the time. I took the position over; and decided it was safer to send Aircraft Y around over Aircraft X on short final. This is what I have always been trained to do. I instructed Aircraft Y to fly the localizer and maintain 2;500 ft. I talked with 3LC to advise I was going around on a 3 mile final. 3LC issued me a 220 at 4000 ft instruction for the missed approach. I instructed Aircraft Y to turn right heading 220. No response. A second time I instructed Aircraft Y to turn to a 220; no response. After the third try; Aircraft Y responded and started turning heading 220. A departure off of 22L was turning to a 110 heading off the ground. The traffic on 22L did not turn immediately; forcing the 3LC controller to expedite his climb.There were several things I saw wrong with this scenario. The first and foremost; C90 should not be telling me who to send around in my airspace. We have always been taught; with the exception of an emergency; to send the trailing aircraft around. To tell us to send somebody around in our own airspace; and add the caveat that he 'slowed earlier than instructed;' which was also mentioned in the MOR (Mandatory Occurrence Report) That is a pilot deviation. Aircraft X slowed earlier than instructed; that is no fault to ATC; that is a pilot deviation. After I sent Aircraft Y around and he did not respond to after the third time I tried issuing an instruction; that is a pilot deviation. ORD has a culture that does not hold pilots accountable for when they make mistakes. I notice it all the time working various positions in the tower; the 'whatever' attitude from pilots because they know they won't get in trouble. I understand that not everything needs to be escalated; but this scenario; in my opinion is different. To not be responding immediately to ATC during a missed approach instruction in IMC weather is not acceptable. In the MOR; it clearly indicates that a pilot deviation occurred with Aircraft X.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1289282</th>\n","      <td>Aircraft X was vectored onto a 10 mile ILS Runway 6. 6 nm in trail Aircraft Y was vectored onto a 11 mile ILS Runway 6. Both aircraft were in a constant high speed descent from initial contact so no speeds were issued because it would have been impossible to slow and still make the approach altitude. Aircraft Y was approximately 6 miles behind Aircraft X when turned onto final. I knew of the speed difference; at the time Aircraft X was indicating about 170 on a 5 mile final. Aircraft Y was indicating about 270 turning onto the 11 mile final. I had two IFR popups that had to be issued around the same time. I issued one and then took a coordination call from ZBW about a conflict they were pointing out between two aircraft they had just handed me off at 070; both just on the border of my airspace. I observed the continued speed overtake just before I took the call but thought that Aircraft Y would be slowing anyway and that I would have time to take the call; then go back and adjust speed if necessary. After hanging up I observed Aircraft Y on a 5 nm final indicating 260KT with Aircraft X about 4 nm ahead indicating 140KT. I issued reduce speed to 170KT to Aircraft Y; to which I received the reply; 'we are slowing' leading me to believe they were already trying to slow down but not very successfully due to the rate of descent. At 3.3 nm separation I cancelled Aircraft Y approach clearance and climbed and turned him to the North. Separation decreased to 2.83 nm and 900ft prior to divergence. In this situation I trusted that Aircraft Y would be slower than they actually were due to the proximity to the airport but the high speed descent prevented that from happening. Due to volume and complexity I elected to turn them on final 6 nm behind Aircraft X rather than go through and turn right back because I didn't have time to explain and issue that; and thought that the distance would be adequate with a normal approach speed. A lack of airspace contributed to the high speed descent. I was unable to turn Aircraft Y to the right to make a longer final due to airspace; unable to turn left prior to that because of crossing traffic and I was worried about going through the final due to parachute jumping 5 SE of the final approach course on Aircraft Y's current heading. The design of the airspace and routes in this area is inherently flawed. Both Aircraft X and Aircraft Y were taken off a descend via clearance due to crossing traffic just ahead handed off from ZBW as well; I had to call them to request the heading prior to handoff. On this arrival routing conflicts are built in because of crossing traffic right at the sector boundary. Until ZBW puts the aircraft in handoff status we are not aware of the potential conflicts; requiring almost no preplanning time and immediate call for alternative action upon seeing the handoff flash. Further complicating the situation is the MHT arrivals are on a VNAV descent where the conflict point is not always known and vertical separation cannot be ensured. I recommend changing the arrival STAR by pushing it north by 5nm to deconflict this area. On Runway 6 there is little to no opportunity to sequence aircraft because of the airspace limitations; crossing traffic and parachute activity. Speed control is highly ineffective because of the high speed descent profile and short distance to the final approach course from initial contact.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1252039</th>\n","      <td>We were assigned a direct clearance to [destination] and assigned to maintain 4000 feet.

I was somewhat surprised by ATC instructions as I'd never heard them like this before. I normally keep my hand on spoilers when they're out but because things got so busy near the end; combined with gusty winds and poorer than expected conditions especially due to icing; I forgot about them. I noticed the final Vref speed was within the red stall tape and this initially confused me. I added thrust but caught the spoilers too late.We should have requested the ILS from ATC earlier in the flight in order to decrease workload.

We had all been given adequate rest by FAR requirements and personally I had a good night's rest and breakfast before leaving for the airport. With our van time from the hotel of XA45 and the departure at XC15 we arrived quite early to the airport. As a matter of fact; when we arrived at the gate the aircraft was not there yet. The aircraft did show up in plenty of time and we had more than sufficient time to prepare for our departure. The Captain briefed the crew that he would be the flying pilot for today's flight. He gave us a full brief as he was both the Captain but also the pilot flying. Once we received our clearance I checked my IPad to confirm the SID and verified the speed and altitude restrictions loaded in the FMS. Our clearance was for a departure via the SID. I have flown this SID before and pointed out to the Captain during our brief that we had a speed restriction at ZZZZZ of Minimum 180kts/Maximum 230kts to cross below 5000ft and also a speed restriction over ZZZZZ1 of 230kts.I also pointed out that our minimum clean speed for our weight was 260kts.

We started our takeoff; I made my call outs and the Captain started his rotation at VR 180; after I called out positive rate of climb the Captain asked for gear up. As we continued the climb the Captain asked for Flaps 5 on schedule. With the Captain still hand-flying he asked for Flaps 1 on schedule. I moved the Flaps to 1 but quickly reminded him of the MAX speed restriction of 230kts. In a rapid event of sequence; the Captain asked for flaps back to 5 as he started to level off the airplane at around 1500ft MSL. This caused the airspeed to increase fast and the Flaps 5 limit speed of 245kts was exceeded. I called out to the Captain that he was overspeeding the Flaps 5 limit speed with to the best of my memory with the events happening so fast; approximately 20-25kts. After a brief moment and verbal inputs from myself and the IRO in the middle seat of the over speed and the climb needed to continue the SID; the Captain pulled the thrust levers back and raised the nose and started a climb which bled the speed off. Tower sent us to departure control and when I finally had an opportunity to check in with them they assigned us a higher altitude and approved unrestricted speed in the climb. Captain moved the thrust levers forward and asked for flaps retraction on schedule and climbed to the assigned altitude. Shortly thereafter he engaged the autopilot. He turned to us and acknowledged the mistake the he had made and apologized to the crew. He debriefed before the IRO's went back for their rest. He pointed out what he had done and that he didn't stick with the plan that was briefed to stay at Flaps 5 and 230kts with LNAV and VNAV engaged prior to takeoff. We all acknowledged the importance of sticking with the original plan of the brief by remaining at flaps 5 and 230kts which would have kept the flaps 5 limit speed from being exceeded. Once the 2 IRO's left the cockpit I suggested to the Captain that we should get [maintenance] on the SATCOM and fill them in on what had happened. The Captain concurred and handed controls over to me while he initiated the call via Dispatch. We also reported the flaps 5 speed exceedance electronically to [maintenance].After landing and taxiing; once talking to ramp; maintenance requested that we leave the flaps at 30. We extended the flaps to 30 before parking at the gate. While deplaning; the maintenance supervisor came to the cockpit and we did another debrief with him where he asked questions as well as filled us in on the procedure that was required by them. Captain called me and shared that the maintenance supervisor had called him and told him that engineering found the flaps 5 limit speed to be exceeded by 27kts.What I take away from this event is how important; especially on a very busy SID; it is to stick with the plan that was briefed. For myself; I wish I would have questioned the Captain's request for Flaps 1 prior to moving the lever instead of moving the flap lever first and then questioning his request. This goes to show that what is normal procedures on almost all the SIDS we fly is not the case on this very busy SID with a very heavy aircraft.This was definitely an eye opener for me being the first situation like this in my career of being in this predicament.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1594170</th>\n","      <td>Approaching in gusty wind conditions 320/19G21 RNAV/GPS [approach] in use.

The airplane was configured to flaps 8; 20 then gear down. Autopilot was disconnected while on a 7 mile modified base to final. The aircraft was on glideslope; but the upgrade student was too fast to bring flaps out to 30. The airplane came through 1;000 AGL at flaps 20 gear down and full spoiler deployed. At this point I told him he was not slowing because his power was not at idle and he was essentially powering through his spoilers. Also I was expecting him to initiate a go around due to the unstable approach. Power went to idle and flaps 30 and 45 were called for and configured. I did not call for the go around because I wanted my upgrade student to realize that we were unstable inside a 1;000 AGL and make the call to go miss himself.Instead; the approach was continued with the airplane being fully configured on speed and stable by around 500-600 AGL. Landing was standard and satisfactory. Upon reaching the gate I debriefed him on the event and told him that inexperienced First Officers may not make the call to go around when the Captain is pilot flying in an unstable approach event.

We made our departure altitudes and continued climb.This all came together at once. The PM was making a call and I believe he mistook what I said. It was clearly a miscommunication. The Captain had mentioned before we left the gate that he had not flown recently; this probably also played a role.

The cloud top was approximately FL340 and rapidly building. Immediately; I pushed heading SEL and selected a heading into the indicated wind; stated out loud; 'we are not going to clear that cloud!' As the airplane passed through about 10 degrees bank; we penetrated the very edge of the convective cloud. The airspeed jumped below the Vmin foot and stick shaker engaged.

We advised that we were unable when on a heading due to the automation (must be in NAV and on a route). ATC then instructed us to 'just fly a pattern' so we fly a race track pattern and timed it for 1 1/2 minutes.  ATC was giving numerous aircraft this same clearance and I heard at least 2 that stated they were unable for the same reasons we stated (automation).  After about 30 minutes we were then cleared to continue to PHL via radar vectors. We were given numerous vectors on downwind and across final all while we had a visual on the airport.

When we were on the ground; I gave a PIREP to the Local Controller and subsequently I heard 2 or 3 aircraft confirm my observations. The concern I have is that there was no indication to us of why we were delayed on our arrival and no indication of possible severe weather. Clearly there was some weather/convective activity at PHL and in all probability was the cause of the delays. We had no indication of possible windshear on the airport. As an instructor pilot; I was very familiar with the aircraft's Speed Error Tape and Acceleration Cue as it pertains to early detection of Windshear. This allowed me to immediately advise the Captain but we were out of it very quickly. Additionally; being aware of a low fuel state puts undue pressure for Plan Continuation Bias.

At level off; we continued to individually assess radar and limited visual cues for storm position; height; and intensity. ATC offered direct ZZZ1; but I declined the offer until we could confirm this routing with dispatch.

However; within seconds we were completely engulfed and turbulence increased to continuous moderate with occasional severe. I monitor the flight attendants on the interphone routinely. At this time the FA (Flight Attendant) at 2L called the Purser and advised her a woman got up to the lavatory. She also stated that they yelled at her it wasn't safe and to return to her seat. However; the woman continued to the aft lavatory. While she was in the lavatory; turbulence shot up to continuous severe and I disconnected the autopilot to maintain pitch and power (auto throttles remained armed; but I physically guarded them). Airspeed fluctuated from stickshaker to clacker; and altitude dropped to as low as 34;800 feet. Event seemed to last two minutes or more. Once we exited the weather; I confirmed with flight attendants they were good and asked the status of the passenger. They reported they were fine; but the passenger suffered a cut to the forehead. When it was safe for any medical help to leave their seats; Purser requested passengers with medical training to identify themselves. A fire battalion chief and family member fire paramedic responded to the call; treated the woman; and fed information to me that I passed to Medlink. Two male passengers also complained of neck pain. Medlink recommended three Tylenol for each passenger and one Benadryl for the male passenger who vomited.

Then he said that we would 'be out of the Bravo for one mile.' In my mind I was picturing us leaving the lateral limits of the shelf of the Class B we were in when we made a turn to the northeast. I quickly looked at my Class B chart for Atlanta and cross checked our position with the chart. In my mind; I was concerned that we were still at 250 KIAS and a turn would eventually put us under a different shelf of the Bravo; breaking the 200 KIAS speed limit. After looking at the chart for a moment; I was pretty certain that the turn would not have us leave the Bravo. Even after a few more minutes of analyzing the situation; I was almost sure that we hadn't left the Class B. It was only after we finished the flight; and I had more time to analyze the chart; that I realized the descent momentarily put us below the 8;000 FT shelf for maybe 10 seconds until we entered the next shelf with a floor of 5;000 FT. We were doing 250 KIAS the whole time; so we broke the 200 KIAS speed limit under the Class B for that short time. ATC never said anything about the speed. Cause; the main threats were high workload and some fatigue. This was the fifth leg of the day and approaching 12 hours on duty. I always have my Class B chart available; but it took me a moment to identify our exact position. Obviously; better situational awareness would have helped. By the time I had crosschecked my chart in any detail; we had already gone below the Class B and were actually back into the next shelf; this plus changing frequencies; verifying the altitude selector and changing headings contributed. After the controller advised us that we'd leave the Bravo at one point; I should have said something to keep us from changing heading or altitude until we knew where we'd be leaving the Bravo. The error was breaking the speed limit for about 10 seconds. That would also be the undesired state.

We had set up and briefed an RNAV approach to RWY 27. The Captain was the PF (Pilot Flying). ATC left us high and fast to prepare us for the imminent slam dunk. To further complicate the approach they vectored us in tight to the airport and close to preceding traffic. As we approached the final approach course; ATC finally gave us descent clearance and told us to slow from 250 to 210 to 170 in about the same time frame that it has taken me to type this sentence. With all automation engaged; the aircraft would not slow down to a slow enough speed with the speed brakes extended to configure the flaps; and descending was out of the question. I had to disengage the autothrottle to get the aircraft to slow to flaps extend minus 10 knots; a speed about ten knots into the 'foot' when the speedbrakes were extended beyond half. The entire time this was going on; we were getting higher above the arrival's recommended vertical path; but we were still at 4000-5000 feet MSL and AFL; so we still had time to achieve a stabilized approach. Once slowdown was achieved; and we were able to configure; locate and get adequate spacing on our preceding traffic; we were able to re-acquire the vertical path by around 3000 MSL. Everything was getting back to normal. We were configured with gear; full flaps on a level flight path with autopilot on and autothrottle off. I was about to re-engage the autothrottle and call for the landing checklist; when we received a TCAS ALERT with an amber dot 300 feet below us. We started trying to locate the traffic in the high terrain area east of SAN and I got distracted. When I looked back inside at my PFD; we were about 10-15 knots into the amber airspeed foot. I realized that I had been distracted away from re-engaging the autothrottle. I immediately advanced the thrust levers and re-engaged the autothrottle; and the engines advanced to full power and then pulled back to a normal thrust level once normal speed was achieved. No altitude was lost. We continued the stabilized approach to a normal; uneventful landing. To reiterate; there was no lateral or vertical deviation from flight path. The approach speed we were attempting to fly was approximately 141 knots. According to the FOQA (data); we slowed to 126 knots for about 10 seconds and advanced to full power and flew back to normal speed in about 10 seconds. He also stated that VStall for our weight and configuration was calculated to be 116 knots.I flew the MD-80 and the B-757 for a lot of years; and in those years I heard countless times about how difficult it was to get those aircraft to slow down and go down. Compared to the A321S or H; they are a dream. The A321S/H is difficult to slow below flaps extend speed let alone get ten knots below so that you don't over speed in a gust. If you have to slow quickly to fit in behind traffic; or descend while slowing; and you extend the speedbrakes; the top of the 'foot' is; a lot of times; above your flaps extend speed. The autothrottle will not allow you to go below the top of the foot. You have to disengage the autothrottle in this instance; or maintain level flight until you slow below flaps extend speed; and hope you can make up for the late descent. ATC seems to be completely oblivious to this issue; nor do I expect that they'll ever understand. So; I must adapt my technique to keep us out of the yellow/red. Henceforth; if I have to disengage the autothrottle; I intend to have my right hand on the thrust levers as a constant reminder that I am now the autothrottle. This is not the normal Airbus MO of setting the thrust levers to climb on departure and not touching them again until they are moved to idle in the flare. The downside to this technique is that it takes my right hand out of the picture; and I'll have to direct the PM to do actions thus distracting him/her. Once airspeed issues are overcome; I will re-engage the autothrottle; especially in a high threat environment such as SAN.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>973859</th>\n","      <td>Cruising at FL 410; diverting off track to clear thunderstorms in the area.

We were approximately 30 Knots fast at MAJIC and we were high and fast at BABZE. We notified ATC that we were not going to make the airspeed or altitude restrictions at BABZE. ATC asked if we could make JEPHS at 210 knots and 6000 feet; which we said we could; but ATC vectored us off the arrival before we got to JEPHS. On the next flight from CLT on the same aircraft we had a 'FMC DISAGREE VERTICAL' message which we did put into the log book. In summation we were flying the IVANE5 arrival perfectly; and we believe that the arrival itself has a flaw that makes it extremely difficult to meet all the restrictions; or if you have 18L selected and change to runway 23; then at that time the arrival is incompatible with the aircraft limits.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1698941</th>\n","      <td>Today's flight was a standard one until Center asked if we could land in freezing rain as we approached ZZZ. This was a surprise because none was forecasted. I knew we couldn't take off in known or forecasted FZRA (Freezing Rain) or FZDZ (Freezing Drizzle); but I wasn't sure about landing. So I looked it up and sure enough it is prohibited as well. We switched over to Approach and informed them we couldn't land in FZRA and they instructed us to hold over ZZZZZ as published. We were at 15;000 feet; 160 kts; and there were two Caravans already in the holding pattern. One; a thousand feet below and another at two-thousand feet below us. There was a 55 to 60 kt crosswind over the holding area at our altitude. We tried to get the Garmin 750 to hold at the waypoint for more than one turn but it kept sequencing us into the approach. So I elected to use the heading bug; with the autopilot on; to conduct the hold. Plus the autopilot couldn't hold the inbound track on the localizer due to the high winds. I found that a 20 degree wind correction angle was necessary for the inbound leg. In addition; in order to conserve fuel we asked for 10 nm long legs and that two we couldn't get the Garmin to do so it was up to me to make the corrections on each leg. Fortunately all of the bad weather was below us and we were night VMC in the hold. After approximately 4 turns in the hold; approach said the FZRA is now light snow. He started sequencing the other two caravans for the approach. We got our clearance to maintain our outbound heading of 250 and 15;000 feet until he was ready for us. When we were cleared for the approach we were 5 nm outside of ZZZZZ and cleared down to 11;000 feet. We were supposed to cross ZZZZZ at 8;300 feet. So I asked [First Officer] aren't we cleared for the approach? He said yes so I selected vertical speed and 2;400 fpm to get on glide slope. With throttles at flight idle we still accelerated to over 210 kts. Approach called and said we had a 100 kt overtake on the Caravan in front of us. So I selected props 100% and still didn't slow us enough so approach told us to level off at 6;000 feet and canceled the approach clearance. I was searching for the altitude hold button on the autopilot control panel. I have been out of the cockpit for so long I had forgotten where it was and while I was looking for it is when I got the stick shaker alert. I immediately added power and lowered the nose to about 5;800 feet and recovered back to 6;000 feet. I asked [First Officer] what was the air-speed and he said 125 kts. So we took vectors back to start the approach again and requested to climb back up to 9;000 feet. As we climbed the icing just got worse. I told him most clouds contain the most moisture at their cloud tops and it would be better for us to descend and resume the approach. We are spending too much time in heavy icing conditions. So the request was made and I leveled off at 9;000 feet and turned left to 060 to intercept the localizer and I got the stick shaker again. This time I did see 125 kts. I recovered again and resumed the approach. From that point on it was a normal approach to landing. When I did my walk around the airplane was coated in thick ice. The worst that I have seen in three years.Situational awareness. Keep the scan moving. Ask for help from the other pilot such as 'please select ALT HOLD for me.'</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1264461</th>\n","      <td>Cruising on Autopilot (AP) at 9;000 direct ZZZ1 about 30 nm southwest of the VOR; I asked ATC for a deviation to the right to avoid an area of heavier precipitation; which they called out to me and I could see on my [GPS weather display].  Once clear of that heaviest area; I turned back north direct ZZZ1; and from ZZZ1 turned direct ZZZ2.  I had been in and out of the bottom of the ceiling at 9;000 MSL; no ice and mostly smooth.   Near ZZZ1 I started to encounter a lot more turbulence and entered solid IMC; in snow and clouds but still no icing.  I was keeping an eye outside to watch in case I needed to ask for lower if evidence of icing began.  ATC called and asked me to maintain 9;000 and repeated the altimeter setting; and I scanned and saw that I was descending through 8;600 MSL; and that the AP had turned off; probably due to the turbulence.  It does have an alarm when this happens but I did not hear it.  At that point I raised the nose to climb back to 9;000; but when I looked over at the Airspeed Indicator (ASI); it was dropping rapidly below 80 knots.  Not wanting to stall in IMC; I lowered the nose substantially.  At this point my scan was uneven and not making sense. I have read a lot of accounts of pilots who are rapidly overcome in situations like this. At that point I decided that the safest course of action would be to continue to descend rapidly to what I knew was warm VMC below me.  I lowered my landing gear; started a rapid descent to around 4;000 MSL; where I broke out of the snow and clouds and could reorient myself.  ATC advised me of closest local airports and asked about assistance; I asked them to stand by.  Once I was back in control and everything was looking normal; I flew on for a while; and continued on to my destination at 7;000 MSL; which from that point would keep me in VMC.  ATC asked me about the nature of the problem and I told them that I lost my AP in IMC and had loss of control.It is clear in hindsight that the reason I was seeing the drop in the ASI was that the pitot was being plugged with ice or snow or water.  I should have had the pitot heat on but did not.  The rest of the instruments could have shown me that; if my scan had been good; but I was only intermittently scanning while the AP was flying in cruise.  While my reaction was certainly a way to stay safe; it may have been an overreaction.   However; I was tired after a long day and knew I was not at my best; and I wanted to get somewhere safe quickly.  I was far from any busy airspace; and [advising ATC] and descending did not cause a scramble to move other aircraft; as far as I know.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1576398</th>\n","      <td>We were given a radar vector for the XX ILS with a clearance to expect ZZZZZ. Due to weather in the area I requested deviation from the radar vector. When sequencing the FMS; I could not find ZZZZZ on the FMS ILS DME XX. I found ZZZZZ1 on the FMS ILS XX. The fixes are similar; but not the same. I verified the fix to expect with ATC and was again given ZZZZZ. Thinking I made an error loading the FMS; I reviewed a few approaches in the FMS. Still I could not find ZZZZZ. Around this time; I heard the autopilot disengage. I asked; 'did you disengage the autopilot.' The answer was no. I immediately thought the yaw damp disengaged. I noticed the airspeed was low. I stated something like; 'your airspeed is slow.' [First Officer] responded; and added full thrust. Although the airspeed was increasing we lost altitude. The airspeed was passing through 200 knots and I mentioned to climb to 12000 feet. The airspeed continued to increase but no change in pitch. I took the controls to return to 12000 feet. ATC gave us a vector to join the approach. I realize I spent too much time fiddling around with the FMS with my head down away from a scan.In the FMS ILS XX; ZZZZZ does not exist. ZZZZZ only exist in the FMS RNAV XX.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1008965</th>\n","      <td>During emergency descent after depressurization; I overspeed the aircraft by approximately 5 KTS.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-a4d715d9-4f47-4fe8-a47a-4db82625ad73')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-a4d715d9-4f47-4fe8-a47a-4db82625ad73 button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
