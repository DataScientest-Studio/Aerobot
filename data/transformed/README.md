# Readme for /data/transformed

This folder intentionally contains no data.

It will be populated with data when the user runs the program ```AeroBOT.py```.

The present ```README.md``` file mainly serves as a placeholder. Its presence ensures that the present folder is cloned from GitHUB; it wouldn't if it were empty.

The user has to do nothing.
